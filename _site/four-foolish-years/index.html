<p>On this day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four years ago -- we moved out of our 2,000 square foot home with the three-car garage and downsized to an apartment. On purpose.</li>
<li>Three years ago -- we moved out of the apartment and were officially homeless, living in a popup camper for six months.</li>
<li>Two years ago -- we were living in Chapala, Mexico.</li>
<li>Last year, nothing significant happened. We were back in the USA visiting family.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this year, it's back! April Fool's day is, once again, a standout day on our calendar. Not because of where we are, or where we are going. Today is a big deal because we have been selected as the winners of the <a title="oDesk Digital Nomad Contest Winners" href="https://www.upwork.com/blog/2014/04/digital-nomad-winner-quit-sold-hit-road/" target="_blank">oDesk.com Digital Nomad contest</a>!</p>
<p>That's right -- we're officially Digital Nomads now!</p>
<p>OK, we were already that. But we were selected from almost 2,000 entries! We won! And we get some amazing cool prizes! Here's what's included in our Digital Nomad Survival Kit:</p>
<ul>
<li>An official oDesk Digital Nomad t-shirt</li>
<li>A super-cool North Face Surge II backpack</li>

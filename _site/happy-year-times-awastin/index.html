Sounds nice!  But I started thinking about it:  8760 hours in a year.  Not all that many when you think of a whole year.  How many do I just WASTE of my LIFE?  This is my most important asset we're talking about here:  MY LIFE!  Only one time around, no do-overs.  How much time do I spend these days just sitting in front of my computer basically doing absolutely nothing?  Not fun, not productive, just nothing; boredom?  That just totally SCARED me!  I'm no spring chicken anymore.  Can I afford to just throw that many hours away?  Trash.  Nothing.  Can I?  Can you?</p>
<p>Then I thought, well, you have to subtract 8 per day for sleeping/staring into space/hoping to sleep, and it's only 5840.  Then you have to spend, say,  1.25 hours in the bathroom a day:  5384.  Then there's time eating/cooking/cleaning the kitchen and dishes, say 2 hrs a day:  4654.  Over a whole year, I only have about 4654 hours to LIVE.  That's only 12.75 hours a day.</p>

When I get to my death bed (presuming nothing sudden happens early), will I say, Wow, I sure wish I'd worked more hours, spent more time playing computer games, spent more time in virtual space doing whatever, spent more time just &quot;resting&quot;?  No I will not!</p>
<p>SO....I hereby apologize to myself for all my wasted time in this one life I have been allotted -- apology accepted -- and I resolve to spend my time more wisely.  I wouldn't just flush dollars for no reason, would I?  No, I wouldn't.  Life is so much more valuable than money.  You can always make more money.  You can never make more life or more time.  Spent is spent.</p>
<p>HAPPY NEW LIFE, EVERYBODY!  What will you do with this year?</p>

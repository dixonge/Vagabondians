<p>Being on the road, we meet a lot of new and interesting people from all over the world and have precious little time to get to know them, perhaps only the one day or evening to form a friendship. I am, and perhaps you are too, a little shy and often stumped for something to talk about. My culture is prone to be a bit distant and untrusting of new people and so I have always been hesitant to ask anything probing or personal and seem forward and nosy.</p>
<p>So I have been searching, and my favorite advice for getting someone to like you is to be interested in them rather than talking about yourself (thanks to a post by <a title="Married With Luggage" href="https://www.marriedwithluggage.com/2012/12/12/be-interested-really-interested/" target="_blank">Married with Luggage</a>). That takes the pressure off me to talk and makes the subject something interesting for both of us. I also found a great article from Ash Ambirge at The Middle Finger Project called <a title="Your Life in Six Words" href="https://www.themiddlefingerproject.org/your-life-in-6-words/" target="_blank">Your Life In Six Words</a>. As part of a survey of her clients, she asked a series of questions. I am including them here, as well as a small sample of the inspiring answers left by her readers. (For the complete list of answers, read <a title="Your Life in Six Words" href="https://www.themiddlefingerproject.org/your-life-in-6-words/" target="_blank">Ash' article</a>) I think these kinds of questions way trump &quot;where are you from&quot; and &quot;what do you do,&quot; don't you? And they open up all kinds of possibilities for keeping the convo going beyond small talk about the weather and whether you like this city.</p>
<p>This first one is interesting and fun -- quick, six words for your life story! Kind of like a Haiku. What would yours be? Tell me in the comments!</p>

<p><strong>In response to being asked to write a 6-word memoir summing up their lives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Her beautiful mind kept her distant.</li>
<li>Took risks, found passion, followed dream.</li>
<li>I am still figuring shit out.</li>
<li>Took leap of faith, landed spectacularly.</li>
<li>Soul searching sentimental crazypants. Dreams big.</li>
<li>Wind in her hair, world's her playground.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In response to what advice they’d give their future children:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you feel safe somewhere, stretch your limits a bit, be a little wild. Then go somewhere new.</li>
<li>Love deeply. Laugh often. Find something you love to do. Be conscious. Give back. Send money.</li>
<li>Be brave, have heart, do what you love, fuck conventional wisdom.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In response to what one of their greatest unfulfilled dreams is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tour the world singing jazz.</li>
<li>Have a month-long sabbatical in Thailand.</li>
<li>Be able to financially support my mother. She was never a mother to me but it isn’t because she didn’t want to be. Her own tormented childhood led her to be eternally 9 years old &amp; she still makes decisions as a child would. Her soul is (ultimately) kind and I want nothing more than to be able to give her a home but most importantly, the peace she’s never been able to give herself. Wow that was intense. But honest. I’m not a fan of phony small talk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In response to being asked what they believe with all their heart:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The world is a beautiful place and all people are basically good.</li>
<li>Mistakes are OK, but mediocrity isn’t. Failure to innovate is a death sentence.</li>
<li>Life’s too short to do work you hate and art can teach a soul how to sing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In response to a cause they’re really passionate about:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean water for 3rd world countries.</li>
<li>Creating a safe, accepting and compassionate world for LGBT youth.</li>
<li>Animal cruelty and domestic violence. I REALLY wish those two things just didn’t exist.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In response to something they’re most proud of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My three year old daughter. She is so intelligent and bright.</li>
<li>Co-writing my uni’s plan to lower carbon emissions.</li>
<li>My motorcycle adventures. Vancouver CA to the beaches of Cabo San Lucas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In response to something they wonder if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My parents will ever move out of South Dakota and into civilization like I did.</li>
<li>I should have gotten married at 22.</li>
<li>I should just pack it in, move to somewhere with a beach that never gets cold, and just be a bartender and swim in the ocean for the rest of my life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers!</p>

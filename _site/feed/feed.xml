		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Conversations with others remind us just how far out ideas of financial independence can seem to many.  Most are content with the typical structure, where the ability to pay for food and shelter is closely tied to the most recent paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversations like this happen frequently with many people, and I come away from them feeling like I&#39;m on a different planet. My ideas seem to have pushed me to the very fringe of society. &amp;quot;Don&#39;t pay any attention to that man, he&#39;s a little crazy.&amp;quot; And I think it is a sad commentary when the ideas of being financially independent, not working directly for another entity and being free to live anywhere are perceived as fringe concepts. For most people the pursuit of happiness begins and ends on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another area where the internet shines brightest. Sure, there are negative consequences too, like information overload (do I really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know about local politics on the other side of the world?) but I can find and connect with like-minded souls from all over the globe. I don&#39;t have to feel so isolated, so alone, so crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope many can find similar comfort here.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Dreaming of Belize</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many moons ago (in the late 90&#39;s) I was a regular participant on the message boards for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fool.com/&quot;&gt;Motley Fool&lt;/a&gt;. A few regulars there spoke of overseas retirements in either Costa Rica or Belize. I found this intriguing and began researching the possibilities. At one point we were actually researching real estate and job opportunities in this central American country. We found a bed and breakfast/bar which was for sale for around $150,000. It was on the main road from Belize City to Guatemala. We planned and schemed and daydreamed. But we never followed through. In the first place, it is probably good that we didn&#39;t. We may have switched locations, but we were not looking for true independence. We were thinking more about independence from U.S. taxes than location or jobs. We got sidetracked by research and planning, trying to find the best offshore business structure. I shouldn&#39;t be surprised it never amounted to anything. About the only thing worthwhile that happened during this episode is that my mind was at least opened to the concept of &#39;sovereign citizen.&#39; Thinking of one&#39;s self as a citizen of the planet, not just one particular piece of geography, was very freeing. It is still very difficult to achieve, but much easier for Americans than most. This is ironic considering that we Americans are some of the most fiercely isolationist people left on the planet. Belize is still on our list of places to see, but we won&#39;t be looking for real estate there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update -- 12-15-2010:  By &#39;isolationist&#39; I am not referring to American foreign policy.  Unfortunately we are all too eager to impose our will around the world.  Yet our citizens rarely travel outside our own borders.  There is probably a correlation there somewhere]&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Stuff</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/stuff/"/>
		<updated>2010-07-02T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/stuff/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Bryn and I got married (almost 20 years ago!) we lived where almost all newlyweds live -- an apartment! It was a really nice area near the D/FW airport. Lots of trees, a park, a swimming pool. We walked and rode our bikes a lot. We shared the facilities with a lot of stewardesses too. And even through we were on the third floor, we truly enjoyed the location. We had one bedroom and one living area, and it was just about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the rent went up a little higher than our comfort zone and we moved to a small two-bedroom country home which we rented from the neighbors who owned it. It was probably 850 square feet or so, a little larger than the apartment. Over the next few years we managed to fill it with furniture and things. But then the landlords decided to cash in on their 20 acres in the middle of a fast-growing high-demand part of town (Southlake, TX) and sell their land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next home was our first home to purchase together, a nice 50&#39;s model in Hurst, TX. We spent seven years filling up the 1200 square feet of home and even built a large shed in the back for our motorcycles and other stuff. After a job change we started looking for a place to live that was closer to work and that&#39;s how we bought our last house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we went all out. Over 2000 square feet, three-car garage. In five years it was full too, although we never had to park the cars in the driveway. Our daily commuting round trip dropped from 90 miles to 25. Unfortunately during these last three years we decided that we had enough stuff. Actually, we decided we had WAY too much stuff! We decided that instead of working the rest of our lives to keep paying for our house so we could store all of our stuff that we would rather retire early and travel. As in, a small travel trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad we didn&#39;t think about that before we bought all this stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we had to get out of debt and start saving. But once that was under way the enormity of the task at hand began to dawn on us. We had to sell all our crap! The motorcycles went first. We did some closet cleaning. Then we started digitizing everything. Memorabilia? You know, the stuff that is SO important that we can&#39;t bear to throw it away? The stuff sitting in a box in the attic where no one ever sees it? Yeah that stuff. We started scanning and taking photos and then either tossing or selling the originals. Some things went to other family members (let THEM store this stuff!). We had a massive moving sale. We had another one. Then we started listing all of the remaining items on Craigslist and eBay. And then we started looking at getting rid of that one last big piece of stuff, our house. Things did not look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appear to have bought this monstrosity near the peak of the real estate bubble and were now looking at selling it at the very depths of the market bottom. A $55,000 equity deficit and the world&#39;s worst mortgage servicer (who took over from the world&#39;s most &lt;em&gt;fraudulent&lt;/em&gt; mortgage servicer) meant that even if we wanted to do a short sale we could not. So we talked to an attorney and did a lot of research and finally just decided to walk away. So far we have spent over $90,000 and the loan balance has only gone up by $5,000 while the home value has dropped. Time to stop the bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we finally packed up and moved a few rooms&#39; worth of stuff into a nice little apartment in town. We live one-half of a mile from where I work, and one mile from where Bryn works. We&#39;re saving a thousand dollars a month and don&#39;t have to do any yard work! We are down to 700 square feet. It feels like we&#39;ve come full circle to where we were twenty years ago when we first married!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we&#39;ll have to do another round of sales, hopefully a year from now. Then we will be retiring and hitting the road in a 200 square foot trailer. Then we&#39;ll try one of those &amp;quot;I own less than 100 things&amp;quot; lists...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>What is a Vagabondian?</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/what-is-a-vagabondian/"/>
		<updated>2010-07-12T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/what-is-a-vagabondian/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think that is a fair question.  To be honest, just saying it out loud — &amp;quot;What is a Vagabondian?&amp;quot; makes me laugh.  It is a silly word, is it not?  But do we even know what a Vagabond is?  To some it is a poor tramp, a hobo.  To others it is someone who wanders and travels.  And to be honest, I had something closer to this last meaning in mind when I coined the word.  OK, so a few people have used it before me, but not in a web site name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is a vagabondian?  Someone who travels, who wanders.  An explorer.  More precisely, someone who has an affinity for that sort of life.  So there you have it.  What is a Vagabondian?  A Vagabondian is someone who enjoys the life of a Vagabond and the company of other like-minded Vagabonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, I just made it up.  I thought it sounded a bit quirky, unique.  Do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Debt Reduction</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/debt-reduction/"/>
		<updated>2010-11-12T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/debt-reduction/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many people seem to go their whole lives without once thinking about actually getting &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of debt. But even if you do want to, it can be difficult. For most, the problem seems so insurmountable that they never try. And yet many have done so, and most use a simple technique usually referred to as the &#39;debt snowball.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried this technique on more than one occasion but always managed to get derailed until we finally stumbled on a debt reduction plan that included the secret ingredient: &lt;strong&gt;the emergency fund.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, something as simple as that made all the difference in the world. Here are the basic steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you have to really want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, generate as much extra cash as you can (garage sales, etc.) for a lump-sum start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, make nothing but the minimum payment on every existing debt each month. Take any extra money and put it toward #4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, put at least $1,000 aside as an emergency fund. This will insure that any surprise expense does not force you to pull out a credit card and derail your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, once the emergency fund is established begin taking the extra money each month (from any income source or expense reduction) and put it all on one debt. Some recommend starting with the debt that has the highest emotional attachment (like money owed to a friend or family member). Others suggest starting with the lowest balance. When the first debt is paid off, take that monthly payment and add it in with the rest of the money and put it all on the next-smallest debt. This way each month&#39;s total debt expenditure is the same. By the time you get to the last debt you&#39;ll be paying as much as $1500/month on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finally got out of debt, it started when my car was paid off. We took that payment amount and started paying it on top of other existing payments. I also sold that car and bought an older used one, then used the difference to pay off the motorcycles and one other debt. &lt;strong&gt;When you become determined and you get creative things can happen rather quickly!&lt;/strong&gt; We paid off my wife&#39;s car and then, at long last, paid off my wife&#39;s student loan! That thing had been pestering us for years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you have a mortgage left over, for all practical intents and purposes you are debt-free. But even though a house can turn from a liability to an asset given enough time, it still requires a lot of time, money and energy. Keeping a house as a home base during retirement is a much more traditional path, but early retirement does not require that you become house-free. If you have a lot of equity or own it free and clear you have more options available to you. If you are like us (see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/about&quot;&gt;&#39;About Us&#39;&lt;/a&gt; page) letting go of the house frees you to do whatever you want!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Communications On The Road</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/communications-road/"/>
		<updated>2010-12-15T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/communications-road/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing that I have spent a LOT of time on is research for how to stay connected while traveling.  The connection between us and the internet is key, and not fully resolved.  Lately I&#39;ve been leaning toward using a satellite dish on a tripod since we are planning on doing a lot of &#39;boondocking.&#39;  It&#39;s really a conundrum.  We want to go where there aren&#39;t very many people, yet we want to use the internet which isn&#39;t readily available in sparsely populated areas.  Last December we went camping in Big Bend National Park and spent a few days with ZERO cell phone connection.  No voice, no data.  Lots of RV&#39;ers will tell you that they rarely go without a cellular data connection, but they don&#39;t go where we&#39;re going.  Fortunately a satellite data plan just needs a view of the southern sky.  Yes, this can be an issue if there are a lot of trees around, but then trees block the sun from solar panels so we&#39;ll be doing some interesting positioning in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not we have internet, we&#39;ll still be using wifi to connect our devices to a central file server in our 5th wheel.  Right now we have two iPhones, two iPads, a MacBook and a Mac Mini.  The Mac Mini will serve as the hub with connected hard drives to store most of our documents and audio/video files.  But the rest of the devices will probably change a lot by the time we hit the road.  By then it is expected that Verizon will have the iPhone, and that might help justify an upgrade to the iPhone 4, or 5, or whatever.  Or we might go with just an iPod Touch and an iPad, moving our voice plans to a plain, standard non-smartphone, prepaid.  We just rarely use voice any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any way, wifi comes with its own issues.  Right now we have Verizon&#39;s FIOS service, which is FAST.  But we are connected using their stupid Actiontec router.  I would replace it but it is connected to the main unit using coax cable.  The iPad doesn&#39;t like using WPA encryption, and the Airport Express we use to play speakers in the bathroom doesn&#39;t like WPA2.  I&#39;m going to try to add an Airport Extreme Base Station to the mix to see if that helps.  Once we&#39;re on the road, the AEBS will be the sole distribution point for our internal network, both wired and wireless.  Connecting that to an outside WIFI connection (like those often provided by campgrounds) adds a whole new layer of complexity, and a good reason to stick with a dish.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Major Change in Plans</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/major-change-plans/"/>
		<updated>2011-01-13T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/major-change-plans/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing endures but change&amp;quot; -- Heraclitus (535-475 BC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long time ago we got our first urge to think outside the box regarding citizenship.  Were we not all citizens of the world?  Alas, governments do not think this way.  But that didn&#39;t stop us from &lt;a title=&quot;dreaming of Belize&quot; href=&quot;https://www.www.vagabondians.dev/dreaming-of-belize&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;dreaming of Belize&lt;/a&gt;.  (follow that link for the sordid details)  Now Belize is just one of many ports of call on our itinerary.  Our plans have shifted back and forth over the years until we finally got sufficiently dissatisfied with our situation to get serious and do whatever it took to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/about&quot;&gt;our crazy plan&lt;/a&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially (a few years ago) we wanted to head straight for Argentina.  Our most recent plans started with a few years of RV travel right here in the good old U S of A.  Now we have settled on a hybrid plan of sorts.  We will still start with some travel here in the States but we&#39;ve dropped the RV plans.  We will have to sell the truck and the extra golf cart batteries, but at least we hadn&#39;t bought the trailer yet!  We&#39;ll still sell my little Kia Rio5 hatchback and keep the good old Hyundai Sonata.  Leather seats, after all.  It should hold all of our clothes and camping gear and allow us quick set up and teardown at camp sites.  We&#39;ve car-camped for years so this won&#39;t be so new.  No need to learn about propane systems and solar systems and water systems.  No need to worry about refrigerator fires.  Just throw up the tent and the cot and we&#39;re done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as we discussed this idea of not doing the RV thing I just felt this weight lift off of my shoulders!  It felt right for many reasons.  First, we had been struggling with the idea of leaving the country.  So many places to see that are NOT America.  We were beginning to worry we might never leave.  The RV was an anchor in a sense, and now we&#39;ve jettisoned it.  Second, the truck and trailer were significant expenses, and not the kind that appreciate in value.  The car we already own and it&#39;s been paid off for years now.  It seemed a very frugal thing to do.  Third, we&#39;ve become quite concerned about health costs and insurance.  I&#39;ll probably address this in more detail in a future post but we can&#39;t afford to get sick here.  Strangely enough this problem all but vanishes in most other countries.  This was a big motivation in accelerating our plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are going to do a bit of a whirlwind trip to start things off.  Family in Iowa and Ohio, with stops along the way where the ancestors lie.  More family in Michigan.  Then a summer trip to Wyoming, hopefully Yellowstone if it isn&#39;t packed with tourists.  Finally up to Washington to see friends near Seattle.  After that plans are much less specific.  We will probably meander south, check out some Redwood trees, maybe sights in Utah and Arizona (meteor crater).  Anasazi ruins in New Mexico.  And then probably back to Texas for a last visit and to sell the rest of our extra stuff, including the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By winter we hope to be in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize, Mexico or someplace in that general vicinity.  Visas generally last only 90 days so we&#39;ll have to keep moving around for awhile.  But that is how we have it planned for now.  Serendipity has already provided a friend of a friend who lives in Costa Rica, and we know some people who know some people that do eco-tourism work there.  So that&#39;s the most likely point of entry, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Compromise, or My Love/Hate Relationship With WalMart</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/compromise-lovehate-relationship-walmart/"/>
		<updated>2011-01-20T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/compromise-lovehate-relationship-walmart/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Up until a few years ago my opinion of WalMart probably aligned with the majority here in the United States.  Sam Walton had built a better mousetrap, and the prices were good so why should anyone complain?  They provide good benefits for entry-level people and buy things from people all over the world.  Sounded like a win-win.  Lately, however, I began to develop a bit of a social conscience and paid more attention to some of the negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the concerns stem from the fact that WalMart is one of the world&#39;s largest corporations.  Many allegations and lawsuits occur each year.  Cases cover everything from foreign worker working conditions to U.S. child labor laws.  Add to this the fact that I generally don&#39;t like shopping there.  It may sound elitist, but most of the people I see in WalMart are not the type of people I hang out with.  Yes, I know, I myself am there!  But I truly hate shopping there any time it is busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately as we prepare for the road we are becoming extremely conscious of price, efficiency and availability.  Our budget will be thin.  Driving all over some unfamiliar city in an attempt to find the cheapest price on apples wastes a lot of time and gas.  WalMarts are everywhere, typically near highways, and have cheap prices.  So sure, our favorite chicory coffee from New Orleans, French Market, sells for a good price at Kroger.  But Kroger does not have locations in every state, even if you add in the many different grocery stores under the parent company.  They probably don&#39;t share the exact same list of products either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So last week we went to WalMart and found out that they carry a chicory style coffee from Community Coffee.  We tried it, and frankly it tastes about the same.  And I have a feeling we will be making many similar compromises in other areas as well.  No, it&#39;s not ideal.  No, it might not be the best for world-wide labor or the environment, but when it becomes a choice between those ideals and us just staying home and working forty hours a week for another four years.......well.......yeah.  Compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 1/23/11:  Turns out, French Market chicory is a lot cheaper per oz. at Kroger than even the Community Coffee chicory blend at WalMart!  Guess I&#39;ll just keep my options open on this one...]&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Our Bed Finds a Good Home</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/bed-finds-good-home/"/>
		<updated>2011-01-23T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/bed-finds-good-home/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have been sleeping on a Select Comfort air mattress for ten years now.  Bryn kept her side fairly firm, I kept mine about as soft as a hammock.  And when our plans included long-term RV travel we fully intended to keep that bed.  But once we changed plans to simple car-camping the bed had to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/P1070847.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Where the bed used to be&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t look like people are willing to pay very much for our model, which was a first generation unit.  New &#39;sleep number&#39; beds will set you back $2000 easy, but these older models can be had for a few hundred on eBay.  Rather than take a big loss like that my wife decided she would rather let someone else use it, so we disassembled it and delivered it to my parents.  It is now looking pretty in their guest bedroom and it gave my Dad a great excuse to clean out a bunch of stuff, and by &#39;stuff&#39; I mean lots of crap. LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move was a great example of reduce, recycle, reuse.  Our parents got a bed upgrade.  They put their old OLD hide-a-bed couch by the curb and someone picked it up within a few hours.  The same people also took and will reuse several other items that my Dad cleaned out of that room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/P1070850.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Current sleeping arrangement&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward we have replaced the bed with alternatives that will work for camping.  Bryn got an inflatable mattress.  I may try it out to see if I can sleep on it.  But when we first looked for something for me we went for  &#39;hammock-like.&#39;  What we found was something billed as a &#39;folding hammock.&#39;  It has a pole through the end of the fabric on each end and the pole is suspended from the stand at two points.  So it has four anchors instead of the two on a traditional hammock.  This also means we won&#39;t have to look for trees to hang it from.  And it will fit in a tent.  A much better setup for car-camping, we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When furniture starts going out the door, that&#39;s when it starts to feel real, like we might actually, really do this!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow.  Exciting stuff, huh?  But it&#39;s something we should probably think about more often in general.  People will sleep on beds for years and wonder why they can&#39;t stay asleep or why they wake up sore and stiff!  The whole bed industry is insane and is a topic for another day, or maybe another blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We resolve this whole issue several years ago when we switched from regular mattresses to the Select Comfort bed &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/bed-finds-good-home&quot;&gt;Details in my recent post on the topic&lt;/a&gt;.  When we switched our plans from RV to camping travel our bedding plans were thrown into the air.  Bryn ended up going with a twin-sized air mattress and I got a folding hammock.  But as it turns out, after a week of sleeping on that thing it wasn&#39;t quite as comfortable as I had hoped.  Unlike a normal hammock, it is held taught and doesn&#39;t collapse around you.  And since the material is canvas-like you end up sliding down into the middle no matter how you start out.  Finally, since I normally sleep on my back my legs end up straight with my knees locked.  It&#39;s all good until you wake up and try to stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So last night we switched beds and I slept like a baby -- a big, fat snoring baby.  Poor Bryn, the hammock didn&#39;t work for her either and she ended up putting her thermarest on the floor.  So today I took the folding hammock back to Cabela&#39;s for a refund and went back to WalMart for a second double-height twin air mattress.  (strangely enough, the store is full of them but you can&#39;t find it anywhere on WalMart&#39;s web page!)  We now have a matching pair of them, and that&#39;s actually pretty close to what we used to have with our Select Comfort bed!  I just wish I could figure out why we didn&#39;t start off with these air beds!  Added together they cost the same as that folding hammock did on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/compromise-lovehate-relationship-walmart&quot;&gt;wrote about this phenomenon recently&lt;/a&gt;, how WalMart keeps trying to make me like them.  They did it again!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Digital Farmers</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/digital-farmers/"/>
		<updated>2011-02-07T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/digital-farmers/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Up until fairly recently (historically speaking) most of mankind was a scattered bunch of clans and tribes, roaming about hunting and gathering.  After the advent of organized agriculture (around 10,000 years ago or so) a shift began to occur.  As food began to be preserved for longer and longer periods it gained in value.  This gain produced many haves and have-nots.  The haves became more powerful and attained the upper hand, the have-nots ended up working for them, usually not completely voluntarily.  In some places this took the form of outright slavery.  In other places there were serfs and feifdoms, closely tied to the concept of land ownership.  Later the concepts of apprenticeships and indentured servitude came to the forefront.  And with the rise of the Industrial Revolution, the capitalist concepts of employment and wages overtook almost all other systems of providing for one&#39;s own basic needs of food, clothing and shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group resisted this employment paradigm on a large scale up until fairly recently:  the farmer.  For awhile the automation of the farming process allowed small family farms to greatly increase production and yet remain independent.  But now massive industrial corporations have taken over even this and the small family farm almost disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people today will still choose the path of least resistance, which is to work for someone else.  In a sense they have much in common with the indentured servant and the slave.  Of course they live in relative luxury when compared to those who lived centuries ago, but they still place much of their security in the hands of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/2011/02/mercado.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mercado&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are still those who choose the path of self-reliance, who wish to plant and harvest, to produce goods and sell or barter them.  They wish to have more control over their own destinies.  Most will not choose actual, physical farming (although small farms are definitely making a comeback) but they share much in common with the farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One further twist which was almost unimaginable just twenty years ago is the internet.  Global connectivity has brought about some interesting changes and possibilities.  Everyone from the largest corporation to the smallest, poorest individual can potentially leverage it for the purpose of providing for themselves.  And while most who strike out on their own will still do so within the confines of traditional business products and ideas, like consulting or freelancing, the internet has produced a wave of people who are trying to take advantage of the opportunity in new and exciting ways.  We are trying to do this ourselves.  We&#39;re certainly not the first nor the last, but it seems to be our best bet to break free of our standard 8-5 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet has had a big impact on self-employment.  It is theoretically possible to run a true business without an office or even a traditional web page!  Those who embrace this lifestyle have attempted to define themselves with many different terms, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital nomad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vagabond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location Independent Professional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technomad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In thinking about this today, it occurred to me that these people could also be called Digital Farmers.  The product varies.  It could be an ebook or a service or software.  But it is unique and produced by individuals or small teams.  It is then sold on the market.  And yet both the product and the market are digital.  Thus:  Digital Farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure if this concept will catch on or not.  It&#39;s an analogy, and analogies can only go so far, but I kinda like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how about you?  Are you a Digital Farmer?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Adventure Takes Shape</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After years of dreaming and planning, we are finally starting to believe that we will really do this.  Notice has been given to our landlord and employers.  Our final round of sales is well underway.  In two weeks we will be unemployed, and a week after that we&#39;ll be homeless.  We can&#39;t wait!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to mapping out our route and trying to work up a rough timeline.  After visiting my parents and brother we will take off and perhaps do some storm-chasing.  Eventually we will visit friends and relatives in Oklahoma City, Topeka, Kansas and Burlington, Iowa.  More relatives in Illinois and Cincinnati, then some genealogy research in Ohio.  More relatives in Ohio and Michigan.  That leg should take around eight weeks, but I have no way of knowing if I am under- or over-estimating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, friends in Chicago and Minnesota (darn near Canada!) with a stopover at Aldo Leopold&#39;s center in Baraboo, Wisconsin.  Then on west to an old high school classmate in Cody, Wyoming, hopefully some time at Yellowstone, then north to Glacier Park.  By July we hope to be at Angie and Rand&#39;s place north of Seattle.  Eventually we&#39;ll head south along the Pacific coast stopping for giant trees and tasty vineyards.  San Francisco is a must-see, then more big trees, then Los Angeles and some long-lost relatives.  Oh, and maybe some Charlie Sheen fan action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we hit Hoover Dam and the desert.  Southern Utah, northern Arizona, back to Utah, Colorado and the four corners.  Final pass through New Mexico, then down to Marathon, Texas for one last stay at the desert oasis known as Eve&#39;s Garden.  If all goes as planned we&#39;ll be back in the D/FW area in time for Thanksgiving and my dad&#39;s 80th birthday.  That&#39;s when we sell the car and the camping gear and hop on a plane headed south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, the current road trip looks to be over 9,000 miles, will pass through 23 states (and possibly Canada) and will last eight months.  When you look at it that way, it sounds much more epic and awesome!  Do you know of anyone who would like to sponsor our trip in exchange for crazy publicity?  Let us know!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Escaping the System</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/escaping-system/"/>
		<updated>2011-03-24T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/escaping-system/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A timely topic as today is our last day at our jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system I am referring to includes employment, home ownership and debt.  All are part of this crazy template we call &#39;normal.&#39;  And if you ever decide you want to become abnormal, the system is designed to discourage you.  From childhood you are trained to leave your home, get on a bus (commute), sit at your desk and do whatever your boss (teacher) tells you to do.  The factories and offices of the world depend on this training.  In exchange you get recess (breaks), lunch, and annual vacations (summer) and benefits (gold stars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break out, you must first determine that breaking out is a good thing.  For most, the system is working just fine.  For some of us, however, it isn&#39;t so rosy.  We&#39;re the ones always looking out the window and daydreaming.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you do decide to hop over the fence and play hooky, you have your work cut out for you.  You have to pay off all of your debt while still paying monthly bills.  Then you have to get rid of all of the years of things you have accumulated, including any houses.  Then you have to save up a lot of money and/or develop untraditional means of income.  Perhaps I should say traditional, as this is how &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; used to make money.  We were all self-employed entrepreneurs once.  Of course all of this can be bypassed if you have already reached a certain level of wealth, either by inheritance or genius invention or other means.  But for 99% of us it involves turning the rudder hard and straining against the raging torrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if your timing isn&#39;t perfect, there are additional hurdles.  Recessions, market downturns, inflation.  All are formidable forces which resist your feeble attempts at self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet here we are, on the brink of escape.  So many of our co-workers and friends express encouragement and even admiration.  At times we have felt like the leaders of a prison break.  The spotlights blind, the sirens wail.  As we reach the perimeter of the forest and the cover of the trees, we turn and see our fellow prisoners cheering us on, watching in anticipation.  Will they make it?  Will the searchlights find them?  Will the dogs track them down?  Only time will tell.  And maybe if we do make it, others will be encouraged to follow.  Because sometimes you just have to make a run for it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>We Are Homeless and Living in our Car</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s official, we are homeless, and living in our car!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been anticipating posting this for weeks now.  Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t exactly make it down to just one car yet.  The Kia didn&#39;t sell the first time we put it on eBay.  As it turns out, this saved us a trip and a hassle as we filled both cars to the brim just to get out of the apartment.  Glenn&#39;s poor little hatchback was almost dragging the ground!  Getting rid of twenty years worth of accumulated junk is hard, and the final choices are the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All along we had to decide to either sell, give away, donate, recycle or trash.  We have been making weekly recycling runs ever since we moved into Denton, but once the cars were full, anything else we found had to be dumped, and we really hate adding to landfills!  If we weren&#39;t such good procrastinators, we could have avoided a lot of stress.  But we excel at putting things off, so we were delivering and recycling and filling up the dumpster right up until the very end.  Bryn even delivered a vacuum cleaner to a co-worker&#39;s office at the courts building right at 5:00pm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we are done with deadlines for awhile.  We will probably take a few weeks to finish prepping for the road trip while visiting with family.  We still have to narrow down our possessions to one car&#39;s worth and sell a few more things on eBay and upgrade some tech gear.  Then it&#39;s all fun and games!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Exit, Stage Right!</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we first started telling people about our plans and handing out our &#39;business&#39; cards I was expecting some negative reactions.  I fully anticipated that some would question our sanity, or at least our judgment.  I expected twenty questions, or a bit of an interrogation.  And yet everyone we told seemed to genuinely be excited for us, even encouraging.  They were jealous, they thought it was a great idea, and they wished it could be them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now left our jobs, our apartment, and even our home town of many years, Denton, and co-workers and friends have been bidding us farewell over the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryn was given a going-away lunch from her boss and office mates, a surprise gypsy-themed dinner and dance from her Jazzercise class, an extra-special Jazzercise class with all of her favorite songs, and a surprise lunch from her fellow court reporters in the County.  In addition to this, multiple people gave her $100 checks!  Obviously Bryn was very loved and will be greatly missed by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me?  I got one free lunch and a hangover.  Draw your own conclusions...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be serious for a moment, we just wanted to thank all of you for the many gifts you have given, the homes you have given to many of our previous possessions and the support.  We hope we can live up to your expectations for our adventures!  We will be spending a couple of weeks in the D/FW area tying up loose ends, delivering a few remaining items, upgrading some technology and selling the Kia.  We are staying with Glenn&#39;s parents and doing a few home repair items as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to finally hit the road by mid-April and head north.  We&#39;ll keep you posted.  Thanks for coming along for the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Why We Did It</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/why-we-did-it/"/>
		<updated>2011-04-15T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/why-we-did-it/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately our attention has been focused on the final stages of transition.  Moving sales, Craigslist, eBay, vehicle titles, Goodwill, item delivery, meeting friends, leaving — it&#39;s been a whirlwind, and it was much more mentally taxing than we had anticipated.  It was also a bit emotionally wrenching.  Bryn, of course, shed a few tears here and there, and even gruff old curmudgeonly Glenn gets a bit misty-eyed now and then about leaving his Denton pals behind.  And one thing that gets drowned out by the emotions and whirlwind of activity is the motivation behind it all.  More than once we have had to stop and ask ourselves &amp;quot;Why are we doing this again?&amp;quot;  And now that things have started to settle down a bit, it seemed like a good time to reconnect with the &#39;why&#39; of it all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we are retiring early and hitting the road is to see the many awe-inspiring places of the world, some of which might not be there by the time we get to them.  Most of the world&#39;s glaciers are melting, including Mendenhall Glacier near Juneau, Alaska.  It has already receded greatly since we saw it in 2007.  Islands may disappear, fire, erosion, suburban sprawl and vandalism can all mar the beauty of places.  And every year there are attempts, many successful, to simply give away public land, land owned by us, the people, to corporations or other private interests.  We&#39;d like to see as much as possible while we still can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor in our decisions is simply age.  We are much more able to hike and explore now than we will be in twenty years.  And getting back into shape takes extra effort and time.  And now we&#39;ll have that time!  No more job schedule to work around, no excuses either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other motivation is our desire to expand our minds.  As much as we think we may have rebelled against our parents&#39; generation, the fact is that the vast majority of us simply move one or two steps away from the philosophies we grew up with.  Religion, politics and general worldview rarely change drastically, but traveling helps to break down the walls that we imagine divide us.  When we have announced travel plans in the past, inevitably the first thing we hear is a warning:  &amp;quot;Be careful!&amp;quot;  This is usually followed with details, such as which parts of town to avoid, and possibly personal accounts of encounters with criminals.  This was especially true when we went to New York in 2002, and we hear it almost every time we mention New Orleans.  And yet we thoroughly enjoyed both cities, and we visit New Orleans every chance we get!  When we visited Mexico in 2008 the warnings were even worse, and yet Bryn says that our trip there changed her life.  Her existing stereotypes of that country and its people were shattered.  It was a wonderful preview of our future journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are many countries, and many continents.  Each one has a multitude of &#39;must-see&#39; places, and yet there is only so much time, and only one life.  We think we&#39;d better get started!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Still Homeless, But Living in an SUV</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/still-homeless-but-living-in-an-suv/"/>
		<updated>2011-04-20T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/still-homeless-but-living-in-an-suv/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently we wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/escaping-system&quot;&gt;escaping the system&lt;/a&gt; and some of the difficulties we&#39;ve faced.  One obstacle that we faced was simply time itself.  Late last year we began fine-tuning our strategy and a target time-frame for quitting our jobs.  Eventually we settled on late March.  We drew up a timeline and marked off all of the things we needed to do by that date.  Initially this included purchasing and moving into a travel trailer.  We eventually decided against that, which had both positive and negative results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for dropping the trailer idea was that we decided to start traveling overseas sooner.  The expense and hassle of a trailer doesn&#39;t make sense for a seven month journey, but ditching the trailer had some unexpected consequences.  One thing we had not fully appreciated was just how much room even a mid-sized trailer has.  Moving from 750 square feet to less than 200 sounds challenging, but it is nothing compared to moving into a passenger sedan!  The Hyundai Sonata has an amazing amount of cargo space, and Glenn is quite the packing genius, but we were still discarding items up until the very last minute.  Rear-view visibility was minimal but workable.  But the one thing we didn&#39;t even consider was weight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a wonderful evening at a bed and breakfast we scooted off to Denton to deliver a gun and some proofreading work in exchange for money.  But on the drive up a couple of things became obvious.  First, the rear suspension in the Sonata was almost fully compressed.  Minor dips on the highway caused it to bottom out with a slightly disconcerting dull thunk.  And with the bulk of the weight behind the rear axle, the front end was raised slightly and this caused a lot of extra sway.  We foolishly believed that all we needed was some beefier suspension, but in fact no one makes those for sedans.  And why would they?  Sedans have weight limits that kick in regardless of how low the vehicle rides, and we were probably over that limit.  The solution to this dilemma slowly dawned on us.  We needed a bigger vehicle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty obvious now, in retrospect, but it took some time for us to reach this conclusion.  We&#39;re stubborn like that sometimes.  We didn&#39;t want any extra delays or expenses, but there is just no way that car was going to make it over the Rocky Mountains and through the deserts for 9,000 miles.  So we began the search for a compact SUV.  We initially targeted the Hyundai Santa Fe for cargo space, cost and familiarity reasons.  Trips to west Dallas and Denton proved fruitless.  We did get a nice deal on a Mercedes but decided to pass on it due to the finicky and costly maintenance issues.  Finally we found a Mitsubishi Montero Sport at a fancy-shmancy luxury sports car dealership near the Addison Airport.  The manager/owner is Arwaan, and he and most of the employees appeared to all be from Pakistan.  The Montero was a trade-in, and it was pretty much just what we needed.  They gave us a fair trade-in offer and Arwaan pointed out that it would have been more if our speedometer still worked.  He also pointed out that we would pay much less on taxes since the end result was a purchase price of only $2000.  They got it inspected and changed the oil and we proceeded to fill up the cargo bay while the heat reached 92.  Glenn almost got heat stroke while Bryn was lining up the insurance over the phone.  But soon all of our possessions were in the back of the Montero, and we came to some startling realizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first realization was that we still have a lot of stuff!  The fact that we filled up the cargo area and still had difficulty maintaining rear-view mirror visibility was sobering.  The second realization was that the Sonata has a crazy amount of cargo space!  The Montero has more, but if you want to see out of the windows it doesn&#39;t have &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more than the Sonata.  But we also knew that we could take our time and repack in cooler weather and probably make things fit better.  So we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also replaced the nearly bald rear tires with new ones that match the front tires.  The front tires were fairly new, so now we are all set for a road trip.  Glenn also cleaned the glaze off of the headlights and cleaned the interior a bit and replaced the air filter.  Everything else seems to work fine.  So we&#39;re almost ready to go, finally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, it seems obvious that we would need something as big as an SUV to do what we are doing.  But considering all of the things we have done this year, from selling most of our possessions to selling two vehicles to quitting our jobs to moving out of an apartment — well, we were bound to miss a thing or two.  And we did!  We probably should have included more transition time in our initial plans.  It is frustrating to still be here in Texas when by now we were expecting to be traversing the plains in search of the elusive tornado.  But our original timeline was probably a bit optimistic, so we&#39;re not going to beat ourselves up over it.  We still have one more issue that we need to resolve that is partially preventing us from traveling too far, and we will write about that in greater detail in the near future...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tales from the Tiki Bar - 1</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/tales-tiki-bar-1/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cheers, friends! Everyone got your umbrella drink? Excellent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few wild days of storm chasing, here we are near Lawton, OK, outside Cache at the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge enjoying the beauty and peace and quiet. No, wait....the banshee call of the kid monsters over there killed the peace and chased off everything. Well, everything except the big male bison grazing over by the potty building! He’s gorgeous and takes no notice of mere humans. &lt;em&gt;toast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I love this place! Note to self: Gotta watch out for the ginormous bison poop piles on the trails within the campground when hiking to the potty during the night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least they quieted the peace-killers at 10 sharp....but not a minute sooner. Good news! They are leaving in the morning! We can stay here a few days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More later....Salud! and g’night!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Us vs. Mother Nature</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/vs-mother-nature/"/>
		<updated>2011-05-01T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/vs-mother-nature/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mousie, thou art no thy lane,&lt;br&gt;
In proving foresight may be vain:&lt;br&gt;
The best-laid schemes o&#39; mice an&#39; men&lt;br&gt;
Gang aft agley,&lt;br&gt;
An&#39; lea&#39;e us nought but grief an&#39; pain,&lt;br&gt;
For promis&#39;d joy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To a Mouse&amp;quot; -- Robert Burns -- 1785&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first &#39;detour&#39; was not due to construction but due to time.  We attempted to do a wee bit too much all at once.  That is how we ended up spending a couple of weeks with my parents before finally driving off.  That is also how we ended up spending an additional week finding a larger vehicle to trade our car for!  But at long last we took off and started our journey with a week or two of storm-chasing.  Unfortunately for us (and a lot of other people) this year&#39;s weather pattern is much cooler and wetter than normal, at least in the eastern part of the United States.  And that brings about our second detour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our initial planned route had us chasing a bit and then driving through the upper midwest to Ohio and Michigan.  Unfortunately the entire Mississippi and Ohio River basins and surrounding areas are all at record flood levels! (see maps below) Many campgrounds are flooded and closed.  And while we might still be able to find places to stay, who wants to camp outside when storm after storm keeps blowing through?  Not us, no thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we finally gave up on chasing storms through the piney woods of East Texas and parked ourselves in the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge for a few days.  It was very windy but sunny and not too cold.  No wildfires broke out while we were there, and we spent a few days hiking and thinking.  And one thing we have concluded is that to avoid further trip delays and miserable camping we will need to change our travel plans and follow our planned route in reverse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After walking through our plans and doing a bit of analysis we think we can still achieve our main goals without getting caught in drastic summer desert heat or mountain snows.  And as if to reinforce our decision, mother nature brought another round of rain including southwest Oklahoma!  Fortunately I saw this coming in the weather forecast and we skedaddled on over to Amarillo for a few days.  We&#39;ll stay just long enough to wait out tonight&#39;s cold snap and then mosey on over to southern New Mexico.  Hopefully this time we can find some place to camp that gets at least one bar of Verizon data service!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Communications on the Road:  Update</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/communications-road-update/"/>
		<updated>2011-05-07T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/communications-road-update/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since my last post on communicating on the road, we have had a major change in plans.  Yeah, stop me if you&#39;ve heard this one before. LOL  A car (or now, our SUV) won&#39;t carry a satellite dish very well (especially since it will be packed to the roof with camping gear) so we are being forced to change our plans for internet on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the resources we utilized when researching this issue are the many full-time RV travelers out there.  And somewhere along the way we decided to go with Millenicom.  Basically we are now using the Millenicom plan which comes with a free USB cell data stick and 20GB per month of data.  Eventually we will probably pick up some type of wifi hotspot (like the Cradlepoint CTR350 router) so that our iPhones/iPads/MacBook Airs, etc. can all get online even when we are driving down the road.  This would be especially handy when we are in an area where AT&amp;amp;T is roaming.  Sure, you can still make a voice call (who does that any more?) but if your Words With Friends app tries to connect to the network you start running into an interesting little-known data cap.  AT&amp;amp;T has roaming agreements for voice that is so cheap that they don&#39;t pass the costs along to you.  Not so for data!  According to AT&amp;amp;T we can use no more than 24MB of data when we are roaming.  That is like 8 songs on Pandora&#39;s streaming radio, or 20 photos on Facebook.  If you go over, they might just simply shut your data plan off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even though Millenicom uses a Verizon data plan with no such roaming limits for data, that doesn&#39;t help if you can&#39;t get a signal.  We already hit a long stretch of I-40 from Amarillo to Albuquerque where we couldn&#39;t get connected at all.  Our friend Steve Miller showed us his amp recently and how it worked during storm chasing, so we will probably be adding a cell signal repeater/amplifier to our gear arsenal in the near future.  FYI, I&#39;m writing this article using my laptop and the Millenicom data stick from the KOA on the north side of Albuquerque, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Welcome to New Mexico (again)</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/mexico-again/"/>
		<updated>2011-05-07T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/mexico-again/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we planned our trip out and selected places to stop and visit, New Mexico received several pins on the map.  Most were in the southern or western parts of the state, but I think both of us regarded New Mexico as the true start of our trip, new territory to be explored.  And then we began talking about places we had been before, and as it turns out we&#39;re not exactly strangers to the land of enchantment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m pretty sure that I was here first.  When I was two or three my parents let me come along to some church meetings at Glorieta.  Just a year or two later, Bryn accompanied her mom to New Mexico.  She remembers meeting Chief Sunny Skies.  (I thought this sounded like someone playing a good joke on the tourists, but evidently there was such a person!)  In 1970 Bryn and her dad camped out at Alamogordo Reservoir (now known as Sumner Lake State Park).  Why someone from Dallas would pick that spot for a vacation is beyond me though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970&#39;s I traveled to Carlsbad for a band competition and saw several classmates from my elementary and Junior High days in west Texas.  And at least once at a time which I can not recall I visited the caverns there.  Finally, in 1980 I spent the summer in Glorieta.  And that is the story of our prior history with New Mexico before Bryn and I met in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then we&#39;ve only been here twice.  Once, in 1992 or so we visited Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Peak.  And in the mid-90&#39;s somewhere in there we went skiing at Angel Fire.  We flew in on Southwest Airlines to Albuquerque and then rented a car and drove to the ski area.  We came up that same roadway today, I-25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So — while New Mexico still feels new and unexplored, we have been here before.  Maybe we&#39;re just seeing it with new eyes?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tales From the Tiki Bar - 2</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one’s for the girls.  Get your umbrella drink and come on over here; it’s kinda personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter who you are there comes a time when ya just reeeeeally gotta pee.  Here at this nice KOA campground one nice thing is their beautiful super-clean potties.  The downside?  They close them for the sparkle treatment for two hours, 11-1 p.m.  Great!  Not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had a plan, mostly for nighttime emergencies to avoid dark hikes.  This time it happened to be daytime.  I ran for my Go-Girl and my new handy-dandy male urinal ($5.99 Walmart).  Got everything in place the instant before my legs were going to get wet!  AAAAAHHHHHhhhhhhh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you spell relief at camp, in the woods, at the lake, at a festival with nasty Porta-Potties, or just any public potty?  I’m glad you asked!  &lt;a href=&quot;https://go-girl.com/&quot;&gt;Go Girl&lt;/a&gt; Go in private or go with the big dogs — standing up!  (picture line of guys with their backs turned, and one super-girl!)  No squatting  and peeing on your shoe or hovering hoping not to get your nether regions defiled.  I had another brand that my friends can tell you didn’t work so well — hey, stop laughing -- I see you!  Hard plastic and it took practice in the shower to use.  This one is soft and has backwash barriers so there’s no muss, no fuss.  Just relief.  Keep the little tube case in your purse at all times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No affiliate program, so I’m not making any scratch here (unfortunately). Just truth.&lt;br&gt;
Roxi sez it’s the bee’s knees!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, girls!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Bigger Tent -- on Wheels</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/bigger-tent-wheels/"/>
		<updated>2011-05-21T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/bigger-tent-wheels/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a saying in the RV world, especially true for those who intend to travel full-time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy your third RV first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course most people start with a small travel trailer and graduate to a larger fifth-wheel. Others start with a little Class C motor home (built on a van chassis) and end up driving one of those monster buses.  I think it is safe to say that Bryn and I are one of the very few to even attempt to travel full-time in nothing but a car and a tent.  As you know, the car required a quick upgrade to an SUV due to sheer overload.  But the tent worked fine, except that it quickly became obvious that steering clear of bad weather put us in a motel room far too often.  So we started looking at an upgrade and eventually found a used Jayco 14SO popup tent camper in decent condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46976090735_c982b37aa4_h.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen this unit referred to as &#39;the palace&#39; and for good reason.  It might sound silly at first, but in the popup tent camper world, this Jayco unit is the king-sized luxury model.  The main box is 14 feet long, 19 if you include the hitch.  But when the beds are folded out the length is a crazy 26 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46976088405_2baf21d7e4_h.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The width also increases due to a large slide-out!  I wasn&#39;t too sure about this one at first.  It seemed a bit large to haul with my mid-sized SUV.  But when I drove 20 miles on the Interstate from Camping World to the KOA Kampground I decided that it wasn&#39;t so bad.  We need to do something to the awning to keep it from bouncing too high in crosswinds, and you can&#39;t drive 70mph with this thing, but the Montero Sport didn&#39;t seem to mind too badly.  It remains to be seen how it handles on steeper inclines, but it&#39;s nice to be able to see over the top with the rear-view mirror!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46976076035_4adf940f15_h.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dealer gave it new tires/wheels and helped fix a few minor issues, but as we&#39;ve been using it we&#39;ve discovered a few more.  Nothing major, just handy-man stuff.  The setup isn&#39;t bad, and one of the locals thought for sure we were seasoned travelers!  We have a fresh water tank, water pump, connection for city water, a water heater, and a small gas furnace.  We also have a toilet/shower combo.  The sink drains directly to the outside, the shower water drains to a grey water tank.  But the one thing that sets this unit apart from most others is the toilet.  The black water doesn&#39;t go into a tank and you can&#39;t connect this to a sewer connection in a full hook-up site.  This unit is equipped with a cassette toilet.  It holds around 5 gallons of black water.  When it is full, you simply open the outside hatch, slide the unit out and walk it over to the dump station and empty it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings up one strange problem.  As great as this unit is, you can&#39;t get to the toilet cartridge access door to empty the black water while you have the main screen door in place.  It seems as if it was designed assuming that you would never need to empty the black water until you were leaving the campground.  Only when the main door is removed can the small external half-door close, and only when that door closes can you get full access to the toilet cartridge.  Seems like the kind of thing they should use in camper design class under &amp;quot;things not to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we picked it up from the dealer we drove it straight back to the KOA where we had been staying and drove into a nice pull-through site.  It was our 7th day in a row, so it was a free night!  We have spent the last two days reorganizing and rearranging and fixing and setting up and cleaning.  It is finally ready for travel, and we&#39;ve got six months worth of travel left for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, back when we were planning on five year&#39;s worth of RV travel, we had settled on a nickname for our trailer.  And even though we ended up with a popup, I think the nickname still fits.  See &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/tiki-barv-reality&quot;&gt;Bryn&#39;s latest dispatch&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the TikiBaRV.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Tiki BaRV -- a Reality!</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/tiki-barv-reality/"/>
		<updated>2011-05-21T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Tiki BarV is open!  Roxi is an excellent little proprietress serving up her special concoctions and showing off Speedy the snake to unsuspecting patrons.  She loves the traveling life and adventure.  Come see us if we come near your neck of the woods!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tent-sweet-tent lost its appeal fairly quickly.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but all our stuff was jumbled in the back of the Montero, and I could never find what I needed without digging and many expletives.  For me, expletives mean I&#39;m stressed, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re out here to get away from, right?  So we looked around and found this HUGE popup palace, and finally got it pretty well organized.   — Ahhhh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how do we get rid of all that nice camping gear so we have room in the Montero and don&#39;t have to lug an extra 200 pounds or so around the country?  We&#39;re open to ideas, so please comment!  We have the tent and a ground tarp, suitcase kitchen, Coleman 2-burner gas stove , two double-height twin air beds, and an instant-up screen shelter.  I put up a CraigsList ad and will pull it if it doesn&#39;t sell and run it at the next place.  Maybe a flea market, set it all up and hope it sells without wasting all day there.  Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s kind of nice to have a &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; again.  The weather doesn&#39;t matter quite so much, so we should be able to avoid the motels that we&#39;ve been relying on too heavily so far, although if you come out to Abq, the Sandia Peak Inn is a great little budget motel with a wonderful owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re both ready to leave Abq and start on this big adventure of ours.  Finally!  We&#39;ve been trapped here by my surgery and getting the camper organized.  We&#39;ve done a few cool local things, Sandia Peak drive and Bosque del Apache, but sitting here in the KOA isn&#39;t our dream life.  We&#39;re off tomorrow to head for Grants, NM, where we will see some very interesting things.  Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight is celebration night, clam chowder, salmon patties, wine and cheese and crackers, with music from the computer!  Whoopeeeee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/meal.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2962&quot; src=&quot;https://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/meal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;meal&quot; width=&quot;535&quot; height=&quot;258&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, everybody!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening (May 14) we returned to camp at the Bernalillo, NM KOA to discover a van full of French youth at the spot next to ours. (L-R -- John, Salome, Julien, Regis)  We introduced ourselves and had a nice long chat, exchanging information and tips.  They have been in Canada for the last year on a work visa, working odd jobs for awhile in Vancouver, then eventually at the ski facilities at Whistler.  Although they are all from France, they didn&#39;t know each other until they met in Vancouver! They are now taking a brief tour through the U.S. before going home.  Two of them flew back to Montreal Tuesday to make the connection to Paris, the other two are driving back to Montreal in their van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for us, their English is excellent!  We enjoyed the conversation, and whatever they cooked that evening smelled so amazingly delicious I almost invited myself over for dinner.  They have somehow managed to transport four people and all of their gear across half of Canada, down through the upper MidWest, back over to Oregon and California, and eventually here to New Mexico in a GMC Safari van.  Regis and Julien shared a tent, the John and Salome shared an inflatable bed they somehow managed to set up inside the van.  They were kind enough to let us take some pictures of their gear organization and themselves (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are blogging about their adventures, mostly in French with some English thrown in.  You can read more at &lt;a title=&quot;COBElife&#39;s Great Adventure&quot; href=&quot;https://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/cobelife/1/tpod.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;COBE life&lt;/a&gt;.  Au revoir!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tails from the Tiki Bar</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/tails-tiki-bar/"/>
		<updated>2011-05-30T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[written 5/25/2011]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, tails -- great, furry, wagging, flagging tails!  We visited the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/index.php&quot;&gt;Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; today (Wednesday) after a long, leisurely hike at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/elmo/index.htm&quot;&gt;El Morro&lt;/a&gt;, the historic inscription rock with signatures and sentiments of travelers to this only sure watering hole dating from the 1600s and petroglyphs up to 1000 years old and native ruins atop a high bluff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wolves were awesome with their amber eyes and musical howls.  The whole place erupted in greeting (chow time, new meat? LOL) as we began our tour with Mikel from Sweden.  Mikel and his girlfriend Jane, who was &amp;quot;giftshop girl&amp;quot; that day so didn&#39;t get to give tours, came all the way from Sweden just to volunteer at the wolf sanctuary.  She said there are only a few over 200 wolves left in Sweden, and their government is allowing hunting of them again.  They are here to learn for 6 months and take back knowledge to join the fight to save Swedish wolves from extinction. Lofty goals for for these great 20-somethings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the wolves in their large, somewhat sculpted enclosures for each male/female pair (neutered, not breeding pairs!) and two &amp;quot;packs.&amp;quot;  Many of their names were changed because they get too many named Dakotas, Cheyennes, etc.  All their animals are captive-bred wolves or wolf-dogs with sad stories of money-grubbing breeders and owners who suddenly discovered their wild animal wasn&#39;t suitable for their household. Ya think?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Wolf2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2952&quot; src=&quot;https://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Wolf2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wolf2-540x195&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;195&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you breed a wolf and a dog, you never know how much wolf will be in each of the several pups.  All in a litter can be totally different.  We learned about wolf vs. dog behaviors and physical build.  It was fascinating. This sanctuary runs totally on voluntary donations of meat, money, and time, and workers live on property.  If you come to NM, be sure to come see the wolves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still at the El Morro RV Park with the Ancient Way Cafe.  The cast of characters here is fabulous.  This little artsy community in the middle of nowhere mostly take chosen names over their given names, and they are a very colorful, tight-knit group.  We have Maqui, the camp manager with Guido, the big fuzzy dog; Red Wulf Running Bare -- yes, bare, the baker; Standing Feather the chef, Amy the waitress; Rosie, another cook; Genevieve, who runs the gallery across the street; and the many other locals that come into the cafe.  Many of the community  just did a production of a play, Sordid Lives, up in Gallup and received rave reviews.  I only wish we had been able to be there.  Descriptions and photos just aren&#39;t enough.  I love this place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roxi is working on getting a better wine selection for the bar and developing some signature cocktails.  She and Speedy send their love and wish you all well!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Learning to Chill</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/learning-chill/"/>
		<updated>2011-05-31T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/learning-chill/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I normally think of myself as a fairly laid back person, moreso than most.  And yet even I have my moments where I get frustrated.  It isn&#39;t pretty.  Today was one of those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of factors, but the one issue that was at the root of it was our propane gas in the popup.  Earlier in the week we found that the gas was leaking from somewhere around the main cylinder valve.  Ortega&#39;s in Grants, New Mexico went above and beyond in attempting to fix the leak but finally had to resort to replacing the main valve itself.  Of course, in order to do this they first had to bleed off the gas in the cylinder.  We just paid $15 to have the cylinder filled, so we flushed that money down the drain.  And once the new valve was in place, we had to fill the tank again!  But all that was worth it just to have gas for cooking, hot water and to help supplement the electric heater which struggled to keep us warm in the cold mountain air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a few days everything was just fine.  Then the furnace quit.  It would attempt to light a few times and stop.  I checked the water heater.  The pilot light would light, but no flame.  The stovetop burners would light then quickly go out.  The tank gauge didn&#39;t indicate that the tank was very low, but I thought maybe we used so much gas with the furnace that we had lowered the pressure too much.  I decided to have the cylinder refilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there was a big propane tank and refilling station right there in the El Morro RV park!  The bad news is that the only person who knew how to operate it was the owner, who was not yet returned from a vacation to Ireland.  Crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about that time I checked the weather forecast and noticed that a late-season freeze was about to hit.  It was just for one night, so we headed to Gallup, New Mexico for an evening at a La Quinta.  Our reward points dropped the cost to $30, an extra bonus!  We then drove around town looking for groceries and a place to refill the propane cylinder.  Once again, being full-time travelers caught us off-guard.  Holiday?  Oh yeah, we remember those.  So the propane shops and banks are all closed for Memorial Day.  Guess we will wait till tomorrow to fill the gas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then this morning arrived.  For some reason I got frustrated about still being in New Mexico and having to drive all the way to eastern Utah just to have to turn back around and drive right back down to I-40.  We were already on I-40 for crying out loud!  And we&#39;ve been in this state almost an entire month!  We&#39;ll never make half of the places we plan to visit at this rate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moaned and whined about this for awhile, and then we finally got ready to go and headed for a propane dealer.  Google Maps took me to a spot in the middle of nowhere about five miles south of town.  There was a small ranch there, and nothing that looked like a propane dealer.  A quick phone call confirmed my suspicions.  I drove back to I-40, went west a few miles then pulled in to Gallup Propane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kid working the pump seemed surprised to see our tank bolted to the tongue.  Evidently no one does that any more (thanks Camping World!)  So he disconnected it and picked it up.  I think he started suspecting a joke at this point.  He said it didn&#39;t seem like it needed any fuel.  He put it up on the scales.  55 pounds, give or take a bit.  That&#39;s a completely full tank!  What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He connected an open-ended Acme valve and gas blew out full force when the valve was opened.  At this point the suspicion fell on our Acme valve, the pigtail, or some other part of the piping in the system.  Either we had a massive leak or blockage.  I began to think it was good we bought a full extended warranty!  We left and drove to a nearby truck stop to take a potty break and think about things for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next obvious stop was Camping World.  Warranty repair onsite had a $50 deductible vs work done elsewhere.  Plus they had other parts we wanted:  a second cylinder and some other way of attaching the cylinders to the tongue.  Maybe a cover as well.  But which one?  It was 130 miles to go back to Albuquerque, 185 to the one in Flagstaff, Arizona.  I liked the idea of moving forward, but it would mean missing out on Mesa Verde and Arches National Park.  We looked up the phone number for the Flagstaff Camping World.  This is what it said on their web site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important Notice: Due to tornado damage, our Flagstaff location is closed until further notice. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since when do they have freakin&#39; tornadoes in Flagstaff?  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was reading.  We both laughed at how ridiculous this was all becoming.  We did some math on the mileage options.  In the end the solution with the least amount of extra miles was to go back to Albuquerque.  It was a long, windy drive.  The Montero drug the trailer back up over the Continental Divide at around 45-50mph.  We survived all the 30-35mph winds, the extra turbulence from all of the big rigs and motorhomes that passed us.  I watched the massive miles and miles of lava at El Malpais pass by our windows again.  It was as if New Mexico was laughing at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we arrived at Camping World.  We knew we would be too late for service so our plan was to set up at the RV park right behind the store and test the gas connections one more time.  So we pulled into the Enchanted Trails RV park and got a really good deal on a full hook-up site -- $15 a night!  We blocked, unhitched, leveled, raised, unfurled, braced and connected everything.  It was time.  I made sure the gas was connected and the valve was open.  The water heater pilot light barely lit, but it would not ignite.  The stovetop burners were the same.  One of them lit briefly, then nothing.  I inspected the lines under the trailer.  No obvious breaks or kinks, no rock damage.  I disconnected the Acme valve from the tank and inspected it.  Nothing obvious, nothing in the gauge.  I held the valve down and whacked it a few times on the tongue, just to see if I could dislodge anything.  Again, nothing obvious.  I reconnected it and went inside to test it just one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flame.  Glorious flame!  All three burners!  I lit the water heater pilot light and turned the dial — whomp-whoosh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So.  Basically we are back in Albuquerque for no real good reason.  We could be camped near Mesa Verde right now.  However, we have worked out a compromise.  Tomorrow we will hit up Camping World for parts.  I bet they will be surprised to see us again!  Then we will book it on up to Bandelier National Monument to see the cliff dwellings there.  Hopefully that will assuage Bryn for not being able to go to Mesa Verde.  And as for Arches National Park, it&#39;s just too far out of our way.  It has been officially scratched from our schedule.  In a few days we will head west on I-40 again, and maybe — MAYBE — this time we just might actually make it out of this state!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tales from Vagabondia, the Ancient Way</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/tales-vagabondia/"/>
		<updated>2011-05-31T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/tales-vagabondia/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greetings from the middle of nowhere.  For real.  The nearest ATM is an almost 20-mile round trip.  Nearest Walmart is in Grants, NM, 40 miles one way.  Here is a mix of unique people dealing with life together in a secluded, beautiful place.  Life and living can be harsh in this high desert area, but to them it&#39;s all worth it.  Here everyone is free to be themselves or figure out who that self might be or become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone we met was just so friendly and caring, we felt almost like we just belonged here.  The natural setting, the people, the fresh air, the solitude combine to make this a very healing atmosphere to spend time in.  It&#39;s a wonderful place to create art, whether it be with paint, music, percussion, cooking, collage, or arranging rocks on the ground, and to just find your expression.  If ever there was a place I could call Vagabondia, it&#39;s here.  Don&#39;t fit the normal city businessperson life?  Here may be where you could belong or reinvent yourself and claim a new name.  There&#39;s no end to the possibilities here for doing good for others, the community, and for yourself, to grow and expand your personal and cultural horizons, even to be forced to learn and grow because of the conditions of life and living here.  Wouldn&#39;t be an easy road, but few things really worth it are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ancient Way Cafe and El Morro RV Park and surrounding businesses like the Old School Gallery and the Inscription Rock Trading and Coffee Co., with workers and customers coming from &amp;quot;nearby&amp;quot; towns, all seemed to blend to make a close community.  In my last post I mentioned most of the new friends we&#39;ve made -- well, I wish I could develop friendships with them, but alas, we leave today after a final breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I probably have formed an idealistic impression of everything I&#39;m talking about, but is that all bad, since I&#39;m here and gone?  Vagabondia is an ideal in itself, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite sayings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(S)he who returns from a journey is not the same as (s)he who left. --Chinese proverb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is certainly true here.  I will never be the same, having crossed the paths, however briefly, of those I met here.  Farewell and thank you all!  May all good things flow your way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tiki BaRV WAS heading for Mesa Verde to discover the ancient cliff dwellings and hike the paths the ancients took -- after a brief night in a motel to keep from freezing our pipes -- BUT our LP gas had some kind of a problem.  We seem to be running in circles, and we&#39;re once again in Albuquerque camped in a park next door to Camping World.  Now the gas problem fixed itself.  Sheesh!  Stay tuned to see if we ever get out of NM or if we are stuck in a perpetual Groundhog Day movie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, everybody!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tales from the Tiki Bar, Tinkertown</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/tales-tiki-bar-tinkertown/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow.  If you come to Albuquerque, one thing not to be missed is Ross and Carla Ward&#39;s Tinkertown Museum.  Fabulous collection of the whimsical and historical along with Ross&#39; skillfully and lovingly carved Old West figures in their tiny town dioramas.  My favorite part was the full miniature circus, complete with authentic carney banners -- authentic because the artist himself was a real circus banner painter -- and original photos from the old circus and carney days.  There&#39;s a collection of old coin-operated mechanical arcade machines, a fortune teller, try-your-luck, one-man band and other wonders of days gone by.  It&#39;s like the ghost of Coney Island pre-&#39;50s!  And this is the highest port in the country since the Theodora R is at her final dock there after sailing around the world on a great adventure.  I could happily spend days there and never really see everything.  Here is a&lt;a href=&quot;https://itchyfeettraveler.com/Tinkertown_Museum.aspx&quot; title=&quot;Tinkertown Museum&quot;&gt; link to a fellow traveler&#39;s blog&lt;/a&gt; who describes this place in word and picture far better than I ever could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/RoxiChicken1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-2998 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/RoxiChicken1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RoxiChicken1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Roxi loved the place even more than we did, since she&#39;s, uh, small.  She got to keep the card from the antique magical fortune-telling machine lady, and she&#39;s now the proud owner of her own mini rubber chicken -- ya just can&#39;t be a real bartender without a rubber chicken, after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/TRex.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-3020 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/TRex.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TRex&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We also visited the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science for a few hours this morning.  Fascinating exhibits on dinosaurs, volcanos, caves, space, computers, and more.  The volunteer docents in each area just love to talk to you and tell you all about the exhibits, and they are deeply knowledgeable about their subjects.  Show an interest and get a great education.  A+++ museum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, the smoke did clear eventually here during the morning, so we were lamenting not going ahead and going up to Bandelier today. So we&#39;re going tomorrow and hoping for the best.  It&#39;s not a place to be skipped if we can help it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as the daylight is starting to fade, we&#39;re back in our little Tiki BaRV as the afternoon winds pick up for our daily sandblasting.  Roxi will be opening the  bar soon.  Come join us for a cocktail!  Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing that I really like about other travel blogs that I read is when they write about where they are right now, not about some place they visited years ago.  We&#39;ve been trying to do that, but the tricky part is that we have been seeing so many places and taking so many pictures that it is difficult to keep up!  As a matter of fact, I (Glenn) am flat out behind.  But I&#39;m about to catch up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for many, many posts about what we have been doing, the details.  And pictures too!  Coming really soon!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge 4/27-4/29</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/wichita-mountains-national-wildlife-refuge/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-07T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/wichita-mountains-national-wildlife-refuge/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I mentioned catching up -- well here goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually arrived at the WMNWR near Lawton, OK on April 27 and stayed for three nights.  This is when we were still in our tent.  No, not the folding tent on wheels, the actual 10×13 WalMart tent that goes on the ground.  We set up camp in the Doris Campground.  Bryn cooked some chicken stew concoction that was delicious!  We made coffee and enjoyed it, and we also took a walk, saw some deer and bison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qJLYtSU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Don&#39;t Look Behind You!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren&#39;t exactly right next to the group camping area, but it doesn&#39;t matter when a few dozen little monsters set up for the evening.  I&#39;m not sure if it was a school or church group, but it seems like they were given explicit instructions at around 9:00pm.  &amp;quot;Kids, make as much noise as you can for the next hour:  Go!&amp;quot;  Good grief.  Yelling, screaming, running around.  At one point I talked to one of the adults who was passing by and I asked him how long they were staying.  He said &amp;quot;Oh, just one night.  That&#39;s about all I can take!&amp;quot;  Eventually they managed to quiet down long enough for us to get to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem we ran into here was communications.  For example, updating our blog, or Facebook page.  Kinda hard to do when there were zero bars for either AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon.  I did manage to get one small update in by driving to the small parking area on the hill just outside the gate and holding my laptop up in the air out the car window.  Ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/crGggqD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I just... need ... one ... bar!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday we did some birding and exploring.  We walked around the park, then over a small bridge which crosses an inlet to Quanah Parker Lake.  We followed the trail around the north edge.  Saw some nice birds and turtles.  Met another couple out birding as well.  The trail leads past a few areas where they hold educational demonstrations on the weekend.  Lots of little monsters got to learn about fire safety and rattlesnakes and such.  I stopped to get some shots of the rattlers with my zoom lens.  Now if only we could see some of these babies in the wild!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PlxwFzW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zoiks!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday we awoke to a small family of Turkeys wandering through the campground, occasionally gobbling at each other.  We drove out and stopped to watch the prairie dogs a bit, then we climbed Elk Mountain.  Nice little hike, not too strenuous, and our first summit there.  We&#39;ve been to this NWR many times when we were rock climbing and yet never went up this mountain before (at least not all the way up).  While we were on top, we met a father/son hiking team.  They mentioned that they had been looking for a natural arch.  A what?  He showed me a guide book which mentioned it and even included pictures.  So Bryn and I explored the top and northwestern edges of this mountain.  We were off of any trails.  We never found it.  But I was feeling rather adventurous, at least until we saw a group of kids scrambling all over parts of the mountain top that were even more remote than where we were.  Kids.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HnEW6qX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the day was done we also drove around to the south side of Quanah Parker Lake.  The dam was very old, tall and narrow.  According to the plaque it was built as part of the CCC project back in 1935!  We also watched some Mississippi Kites soaring over the lake for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v3sPUbL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday we hiked out to the 40-foot hole area.  I have fond memories of rock climbing here.  The river bed is all rock on both sides, and even under the water.  The water has carved paths and pools here.  We hiked in from a different side than I had taken before and passed the Lost Lake Dam.  A plaque on the far side states that it was built in 1926 and was &amp;quot;Lawton&#39;s Contribution to the Playground of the Southwest.&amp;quot;  On the spillway side you can see that it is a sloping pile of rocks grouted together.  Really old-school!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed puttering around and saw no other people while we were there, always a bonus.  Got some nice shots of Canada Geese in flight as well.  On the way back in, we stopped at the entrance to the Narrows, one of our all-time favorite climbing areas.  There is a really old cabin there, built by the Lawrence family in 1912.  We also saw some kids free-climbing some routes.  I&#39;m glad we left before someone got hurt and had to call in a rescue.  On the drive back to the campground we saw a baby bison, very cute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C3pm8Kj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been keeping an eye on the forecast and it looked like a good chance for midnight thunderstorms, so we broke camp and drove on to Amarillo.  I tried to take video of Bryn nodding off in the car.  So cute!  We also saw a big woman with a hammer in her front pants pocket at a convenience store.  If she was in the big city, she would have been hanging out at WalMart, guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jzjtCwO.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the whole album of photos...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Albuquerque, New Mexico -- May 3-8</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/albuquerque-mexico-3-8/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-09T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/albuquerque-mexico-3-8/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tuesday we packed it all up and headed west. We somehow completely missed Cadillac Ranch! Oh well, at least we&#39;ve been there before...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We briefly celebrated our passage across the New Mexico border and then continued west. The view from the road is mostly desert out here. If it wasn&#39;t for the signs at the border, you&#39;d never know the difference between the Texas panhandle and eastern New Mexico. We stopped briefly for gas at a small mom-and-pop station, and we also took a few pictures at Santa Rosa. Original Route 66 architecture and signage is rare, but they have a few places in every town. I enjoy trying to spot the old stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/3416/5692539686_e191f86ecb_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Original Route 66&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we arrived in Albuquerque we made our way to Sandia Peak Inn on the Historic Route 66. We found out about this little place from Trip Advisor where it gets rave reviews. The owners (Kay and her husband) moved from India to California in the &#39;70&#39;s. After the kids had all gone to college they moved to Albuquerque and bought a piece of land in a part of town that had become a bit run-down. The one structure on this lot was a motel that rented by the hour, and not surprisingly the main clientele were there for drugs or prostitution. They demolished that building and put up a very nice hotel from scratch. The owners live on the premises, so it is an odd cross between a hotel and a bed and breakfast. Over the years they have slowly but surely upgraded and maintained everything. The architecture and stucco and paint gives you the impression that it could have been an original old Route 66 facility. In fact, it is less than ten years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/3251/5691976111_b291d354fd_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New-old&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay is the main person you will deal with, and she takes hospitality and customer service very seriously. If you use a coupon from one of the books you pick up at the visitor center, you will get a basic room on the second floor. But if any other room is available, Kay will be sure to offer you an upgrade for a very minimal price. Large-screen LCD TV&#39;s and whirlpool baths are usually available. They also have a laundry room and a heated indoor pool as well. All of this will set you back $50-60 per night. In case you couldn&#39;t tell, Bryn and I thoroughly enjoyed this place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner our first night in town we chose the St. Clair Winery and Bistro. We tasted a flight and eventually chose a glass to go with. Both the wine and the food were great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33991908538_08fc6d4b25_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wine!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we did some work and then took a break and did a short hike through the Petroglyph National Monument just before they closed. The trails are mostly sand, the petroglyphs are all on volcanic rock. We did get to see some interesting wildlife though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/3443/5692541754_d4b0228dab_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ancient art&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday we began our search for a popup camper in earnest. We drove through all of the RV dealerships on the east side of town, still on Route 66. We also found a nice Fleetwood on Craigslist. The only negative was the price, a bit steep for us. We also found what would eventually be our popup, a large dual-axle 14-foot Jayco Eagle. Everything seemed to work, but since it was on consignment the dealer was due to inspect it and make sure that it was safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday morning we went hiking along the Rio Grande. The trail was full of runners and bicycles, so we took the first bridge we could over the levee and hiked down to the river itself to enjoy the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47869253101_a7b0a934df_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bryn down at the river&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night we vacated the hotel and set up camp at the KOA on the north side of town, in the suburb of Bernalillo. It is mostly quiet, the staff is wonderful, and you get free coffee and pancakes every morning! Hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Amarillo -- May 1 and 2</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/amarillo-1-2/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-09T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/amarillo-1-2/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After escaping the rain in Lawton and the scary lady with a hammer, we stopped for a couple of days of work in Amarillo at the La Quinta East. I wrote stuff, Bryn wrote stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were there someone posted a picture of a ridiculous looking plane that was supposedly at the Amarillo Airport. Steve Miller said it should still be there, so we took a break to go see it. And there it was! Twice as tall as Southwest Airlines&#39; 737&#39;s. Very odd looking. No wonder they call it the Flying Guppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/3340/5692525260_597b66b152_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guppy vs. 737&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems that NASA acquired this thing to haul things around, like pieces of space shuttle or, in this case, a Bell Osprey. The nose of the plane swings to the right like a door, then you slide stuff inside. Strange, but true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was there I noticed another car pull up behind ours and the driver appeared to be writing down our temporary tag numbers. I wandered back over there and the driver asked what I was doing. I looked back at the plane, looked at him, looked back at the plane and pointed at it and said &amp;quot;It&#39;s a flying guppy!&amp;quot; He acted like this was no big deal. I asked him who he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#39;m Floyd.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have just laughed. Instead I said &amp;quot;Oh&amp;quot; and just walked back to take more pictures. I kinda thought he might have been with the FAA or the airport, but no, he&#39;s just an idiot who thought he had caught the next al Qaeda plot in action. Targeting the flying guppy. In Amarillo. What a maroon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I got photos of the plane, we discovered what appeared to be an old abandoned terminal building. The sign said &amp;quot;English Field.&amp;quot; After taking several photos we drove to the east side of the airport and discovered what appeared to be an old military complex. Large water towers with the typical checkered paint job, now fading. Lots of streets and curbs but very few buildings left. I took a lot more pictures, and we enjoyed some of the wildlife that now occupies this area, mainly jackrabbits and birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/3389/5692527270_695d2b6965_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rabbits everywhere!&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/3327/5691960171_e5d10bc320_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Swallow swarm&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aldo Leopold&lt;br&gt;
After we got back to the hotel I Googled it and discovered that English Field was the commercial airport back in the day, and that the runways now being used by Amarillo International used to be part of an Army Air Field started up back in World War II. Since then thousands of jet crew and mechanics were trained there, the B-17 Flying Fortress flew out of there, and it also used to be a SAC base and boot camp. All the military stuff is long gone, but the runways make it ideal for things like space shuttles and flying guppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/2023/5692524184_312d25a333_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Abandoned terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we met an old friend and storm-chasing buddy &lt;button data-balloon=&quot;Unfortunately we&#39;re no longer in contact since he went all alt-right on us&quot; data-balloon-pos=&quot;up&quot;&gt;Steve Miller&lt;/button&gt; for lunch. We ended up spending 3-4 hours getting caught up on self-employment, love lives and storm chasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the full photo album:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Wallow Fire -- Eastern Arizona</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/wallow-fire-eastern-arizona/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-09T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/wallow-fire-eastern-arizona/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On May 29 an unattended campfire started what has now become the 3rd or 2nd largest fire in Arizona history at over 300,000 acres. [&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: the fire topped out over 500,000 acres, the largest in state history] On June 2, the day the winds first whipped this fire into a massive beast, smoke poured across the state line into western New Mexico and settled into the Rio Grande valley, covering the greater Albuquerque area in smoke and ash. The city&#39;s emergency management facilities were overwhelmed with calls to 911 and 511 reporting a fire. The city finally got through to all of the local news channels to tell people to stop calling so that real emergencies could be reported. Fire crews drove all over looking for actual fires but found none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234987309851430&amp;amp;set=a.234686909881470.82276.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234987309851430&amp;amp;set=a.234686909881470.82276.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took awhile but word finally got out that the smoke was from Arizona. Smoke from that fire has been seen as far away as Iowa! After we finally managed to get out of town and headed for Arizona ourselves on Monday, June 6, we still had to drive through the smoke near Gallup on I-40. By this time the smoke wasn&#39;t as bad or as thick, and soon we were in clear skies. But the massive smoke plume was easily visible both that day in Holbrook and the next day when we visited the Petrified Forest National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234687149881446&amp;amp;set=a.234686909881470.82276.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234687149881446&amp;amp;set=a.234686909881470.82276.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few pictures I took from different vantage points:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Winslow, Arizona -- June 8</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/winslow-arizona-june-8/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-10T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/winslow-arizona-june-8/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Woke up in Holbrook and packed up and folded down. We&#39;re getting pretty good at this! It takes us 15-30 minutes to pack up clothes and misc. items and transfer them to the Montero, then a good 30 minutes to zip, fold, flip, slide, disconnect, stow and crank down the top on the popup. Learned a little lesson about water pressure today, too. See, up until now we turn off the water faucet, disconnect the hose, and all the excess water pressure in the system bleeds out of the hose end. BUT — we had to get smart and add a quick-connect thingamabob to the side of the trailer. And one thing about quick-connects is that, well, when you DISconnect one side of this connection, the other side seals off. So when we did this today, the trailer water was still under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235295969820564&amp;amp;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235295969820564&amp;amp;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So any way, we decided to bleed all the water out of the hot water heater because at 8.3 pounds per gallon, that&#39;s about 50 extra pounds to tow around. So I unscrew the drain plug and — wait for it..... — whoosh! Pressurized hot water all over my pants leg. Felt kinda stupid. At least it wasn&#39;t TOO hot...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any way, we finally got on the road and our next stop was Winslow, Arizona. I found an intersection with a street sign, and as a bonus the light pole behind it had a flag/banner with the town name on it. That was the picture I had envisioned. Of course the town is aware of its infamy in song too. Jackson Browne visited in 1971 and wrote a song about it. Glenn Frey finished off one of the verses and the Eagles recorded it and put it on their first album. It became a trademark of their sound, and put Winslow, Arizona on the map for a whole generation. I have to imagine that countless thousands of people stopped here just because of that song. Of course, it didn&#39;t hurt that historic Route 66 passed through town, but the vast majority of travelers just zipped on by on I-40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234606203222874&amp;amp;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234606203222874&amp;amp;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 90&#39;s a number of initiatives to revitalize Winslow took shape. One of them involved the famous song. In 1999 the town dedicated the &amp;quot;Standing On The Corner Park&amp;quot; so now you can pose next to a statue of what appears to be Jackson Browne in front of a mural which contains an Eagle, a couple in a window, and a girl in a flat bed ford, all the while being seranaded by Eagles tunes coming from the gift shop next door. So we posed and took pictures like all the other turistas, but I&#39;m glad I got my own separate photo that I consider unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235311309819030&amp;amp;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235311309819030&amp;amp;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though that song and that park draw tourists in, the main tourist attraction in town is La Posada. We first heard about this place from the owner of Tinkertown in Albuquerque. She raved about it, and rightly so! This building is amazing. It was the last link in an entire chain of railroad hotels set up by Fred Harvey. His chain brought linen tablecloths and silverware to an otherwise rough old west railroad travel at several major stops on the Santa Fe line. It was immortalized in a movie starring Judy Garland called &amp;quot;The Harvey Girls.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234606099889551&amp;amp;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234606099889551&amp;amp;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Posada was designed by renowned Southwest architect Mary Colter. It was open from 1930 to 1957. Santa Fe Railways auctioned off the museum-quality furnishings in 1959 and gutted half of the building for office space in the early 1960&#39;s. Several times it was scheduled for demolition, and in 1994 the railway moved out for good, again promising demolition. The current owners obtained it after many years of legal negotiations and began renovations in 1997. Allen Affeldt and his wife Tina Mion have done a miraculous job so far. And the future plans are no less incredible! I could write about this for a long time, but I will spare you and instead refer you to links (below) where you can find out everything there is to know about this wonderful place.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Grand Canyon -- Introduction</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/grand-canyon-introduction/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-11T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/grand-canyon-introduction/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After leaving Winslow we drove through Flagstaff and on to Williams, Arizona. About nine miles north of I-40 is an interesting little place near Red Lake which is a combination gas station/convenience store/hostel/RV park. The RV spots are out back and are very basic, just water and electricity. But restrooms are close and very nice, and coin-operated showers are available as well. It is a nice and inexpensive place to begin our exploration of the South Rim from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as we had the trailer set up we took off for the park to get a first glimpse before dark. Our National Parks Passport got us in for free, saving us $25. Soon we&#39;ll break even on the Passport purchase! We drove past the main visitor center over to Yavapai Point. Unlike Clark Griswold, we did not merely glance and leave! We took many photos in the last thirty minutes before sundown, then joined everyone else enjoying the setting sun. We even got to see a California Condor soaring on the updrafts. Soon the sun began to set, and as the last of the orange ball disappeared over the horizon a collective sigh was uttered and then everyone got up to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235624139787747&amp;amp;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235624139787747&amp;amp;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back out of the park I took a wrong turn which took us past a sign that mentioned something about an evening program. We investigated further and it turned out to be a presentation on the California Condors and their rescue from near-extinction. It was very informative and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove back up and stopped at all of the main lookouts and attractions from the visitors center eastward to the Desert View Watchtower. After that we drove around and explored the Geology Museum, the market village, and the lodge area. On the way back south we stopped in Tusayan and investigated the Grand Canyon Camper Village. It seemed about as basic as where we were staying, and was a little more expensive, but it was 45 miles closer to the park! We made reservations for the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Now We&#39;re Cooking With Gas</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/cooking-gas/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-12T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/cooking-gas/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just thought I would give an update on our gas situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my previous posts, you may remember our problems with the gas system working and not working and back and forth. The night we pulled back in to the RV park right next to Camping World in Albuquerque I was able to get all gas appliances, including the furnace, to work. Here is the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the night the furnace stopped working again. In the morning we took the trailer back to Camping World. We had an appointment. While we drove around and ran some errands, the technicians there attempted to make the furnace fail again. When they finally called us it had worked for 12 attempts in a row. After we arrived we tried it again ourselves. It lit every time, the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing they had actually done to it was that one of their techs had &amp;quot;blown it out,&amp;quot; whatever that means. So we took the trailer back next door to the Enchanted Trails RV Park and set it all up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, the furnace stopped working again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning, as we lay in our sleeping bags, too cold to get out, with our 1500 Watt electric heater straining to keep the temperature up to 55 degrees, Bryn had an idea. Maybe, just maybe, it was the $13 Wal-Mart tank gauge that was causing the problem? I thought it was probably the regulator, but the gauge was something that I could test much more easily. So I got up and tested a few things. The stovetop burners could be lit, but the flame fluctuated. The furnace was definitely not getting enough gas to light. So I got dressed, grabbed a crescent wrench and went outside and removed the gauge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, as they say, is all she wrote. It&#39;s been a week now, and we haven&#39;t had a single problem with our gas or our furnace!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Williams, Arizona</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/williams-arizona/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-16T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/williams-arizona/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What? You&#39;ve never heard of the famous Williams, Arizona?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, me neither. But, that is where we ended up for almost a week. This time it wasn&#39;t due to system issues with the trailer, more like system issues with Glenn. Some sort of head cold: congestion, sore throat, coughing. Not an ideal condition for hiking on dry, dusty trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there were actually a few things to do and see in the area. Williams, Arizona bills itself as the Gateway to the Grand Canyon. Of course there are plenty of other routes you can use that don&#39;t go through Williams, but they do have a few things going for them. There is a nice road that goes straight north out of Williams to the southern entrance of the park. It is about sixty miles away. They also have a nice train that runs from Williams to the Canyon and back every day. And Williams also happens to be on historical Route 66. Add all those together and you have yourself a tourist haven! We mainly went into town for groceries, laundry, and the occasional movie rental, but it looked like a fun place to visit if you ride a motorcycle or are out exploring with the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237124342971060&amp;amp;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237124342971060&amp;amp;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Highway 64 going north you will pass the Red Lake Texaco about 8 miles north of I-40. That is where we holed up. Nice, cheap RV sites out back. LOTS of tour buses stop here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237123806304447&amp;amp;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237123806304447&amp;amp;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the road to the park is populated only by the occasional tourist trap, which typically consist of a gas station, Navajos selling jewelry and pottery, and one or two other services thrown in. We got a kick out of Bedrock City in Valle, AZ. It is an RV park, restaurant, gift shop, and some kind of amusement park all themed on, yes, the Flintstones. It looks like it was built in the 60&#39;s and then left to rot. But they will still charge you $5 to go in and see the dinosaur slide, the graffiti-filled buildings, the decaying rides and attractions that used to work...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I had already read about this place online, so we just pulled up out front, got a few pictures, and saved ourselves $10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday we packed up, drove into Flagstaff, picked up our new WiFi Hotspot device and drove north through the desolate (yet pretty) landscape that is Arizona to the Kaibab CampeRVillage up on the plateau. Today&#39;s agenda includes a 40-mile drive down to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon to see what we can see. More pics soon!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Grand Canyon -- North Rim</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago Bryn and I got all packed up and headed north. After leaving Flagstaff we crossed a barren stretch of land. Most of the Native American reservations appear this way. The one good thing about rez land out here is that at least there is an ancient connection between the people and the land. There are many ancient ruins indicating thousands of years of Pueblo and Navajo ancestors. But it&#39;s still desert, and we took anything resembling decent land away long ago. But I digress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/252925_237999046216923_218850_n.jpg&quot;&gt;https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/252925_237999046216923_218850_n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crossed the Little Colorado River and then eventually made it to the main branch, crossing it at the site of the Navajo Bridge. The original old bridge was built in 1927, and at the time it was the only place to cross the Colorado River for 400 miles in either direction. And it pretty much stayed that way for a long time. Seventy years passed before a new bridge was built to handle the increased traffic and vehicle sizes and to provide safety for the inevitable pedestrian traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237074586309369&amp;amp;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237074586309369&amp;amp;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237074776309350&amp;amp;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237074776309350&amp;amp;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then traveled through more desolate land, and up windy roads until we got to the top of the Kaibab Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237999202883574&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237999202883574&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point on in to camp, it was all trees. Pinyon Pines, Ponderosa Pines. Tall trees. It was nice to camp in the trees for once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as we had the TikiBaRV all set up in the Kaibab CampeRVillage (yes, I know, that is a lot of crazy letter play) we took off to see the canyon from the north side. It was a good 40 miles to get there, and most of it goes through a large open meadow in the middle of forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682276248600&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682276248600&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got there we wandered into the main lodge building. The original lodge burned down just a few years after construction, but the replacement has been here since 1937.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675376249290&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675376249290&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went into the bar, which is also the coffee shop. Unfortunately the afternoon bartender isn&#39;t a barista, so no espresso for Glenn &lt;em&gt;sob&lt;/em&gt; -- so we had coffee instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675659582595&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675659582595&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lodge lobby connects to a large viewing room with floor to ceiling windows, large comfy chairs and couches and a massive view of the canyon. The construction is all heavy timber and stone. It is the quintessential lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675999582561&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675999582561&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we went back down for some hiking. We started off with the easy stuff, the Bright Angel Point trail, and the Transept Trail. Bright Angel Point goes out a narrow ridge to a great overlook point. It is easily accessible from the Lodge, thus everyone goes there. Very crowded. On the way back, if you take the branch to the left you go below the lodge. Once we passed the lodge, the traffic disappeared. We hiked around the edge and eventually came back to the main road after cutting through the employee lodging area. Two or three hours of hiking through trees. It was very nice. Bryn hugged a lot of Ponderosa Pines too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237680656248762&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237680656248762&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the lodge we saw some chipmunks and a Stellar&#39;s Jay! We also saw an older guy taking pictures of the canyon with a white iPad 2. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237681576248670&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237681576248670&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning as I was working on the computer and Bryn was cooking breakfast I saw something out of the corner of my eye through our vinyl window. At first I thought it was someone&#39;s pet, but I focused for a second and there it was -- a Kaibab Squirrel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237681952915299&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237681952915299&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on a mission, so I barely got any photos before it was too far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682162915278&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682162915278&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the cousin of the Abert&#39;s Squirrel on the South Rim, which we never got to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast we drove back down to the rim, taking an eastern road that led up to Cape Royal. A LOT of people go here, because it is a very short hike to the rim and it is a spectacular view. Nearby is the Angel Window, also quite spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682412915253&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682412915253&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back in we did the hike out to Cape Final, about three hours round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237684689581692&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237684689581692&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237685129581648&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237685129581648&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back to the campsite we were treated to an awesome sunset viewed through the dead trees of the Outlet Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237685686248259&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237685686248259&amp;amp;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of signs at all of the National Parks talking about fire. Evidently the Park Service has finally figured out that fires are natural and should not necessarily be put out every time one starts up. Because if you do, then all of the fuel (dead trees and limbs) just builds up and then you have a massive fire that is bad. And by bad, I mean that it kills ALL the trees. Normal fires don&#39;t. Yep, yet another example of man screwing up nature. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hoodoo You Think You Are?</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/hoodoo-are/"/>
		<updated>2011-06-29T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Georgia} --&gt;Pictures of Bryce Canyon evoke wonder, but taking in the view from Inspiration Point for the first time in person takes your breath away.  An open-mouthed &quot;Whohhhhhhhhhh&quot; is about all I could muster from my overwhelmed senses.  The heady aroma of warm Ponderosa pine in the late afternoon mountain sun tipped my brain right over the precipice down into the hoodoos. The trail through the canyon beckoned that I should just run right down there and lose myself in their mysterious fairytale world, never to return.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249780888372072&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249780888372072&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately sanity eventually returned, if I ever had it to begin with, and I settled for a promised trip down in the morning.  The ranger suggested that it&#39;s best to begin at Sunrise Point and end at Sunset Point for the &amp;quot;best three-mile hike on earth.&amp;quot; We were filled with glee as the view changed dramatically every few steps.  The cameras were going to get a workout today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249784715038356&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249784715038356&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long, yet still fairly steep, switchbacks seemed to confirm the choice of direction, as we marveled at how hard the people had to work to get up out of the canyon as we descended.  As we got deeper, the hoodoos seemed to grow taller as they dwarfed us in their mystic shadows.  The colors seemed to intensify as they worked their witchery on us.  On we went, around and through this natural wonderland, hoping we wouldn&#39;t fall into any rabbit holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249786228371538&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249786228371538&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound through and ended up in a nice pine forest for a while.  We took an apple break in the lap of a friendly tree.  Then as we sat in its shade we spied a lone figure lying in a tree across the way.  We watched as people passed him up, laughing at his misfortune.  He seemed so sad sitting there.  No telling how long he&#39;d been there.  We took our time on our break, and no one came to rescue him, so we decided to save him and he rode behind me, waving to people out of my backpack, just in case we would pass his original negligent owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249791031704391&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249791031704391&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249792411704253&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249792411704253&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249794008370760&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249794008370760&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon we came to the way up out of the canyon.  It looked like nice long switchbacks, and we were glad.  Little did we know that we were in for straight-up, zipper switchbacks carved into the side of the mountain after  passing through a near slot canyon space that was filtering very welcome cool air through the rocks.  But the entire experience was well worth the panting effort to get back out, safe and sound and free of hexes....maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249803251703169&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249803251703169&amp;amp;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way back to the car and no one exclaimed as we passed by, and that&#39;s how Roxi got her new friend....Soxi.  Perhaps Soxi has some mysterious ways about him, but he seems happy to ride balanced in the crook of the assist handle by the windshield with Roxi in the higher crows nest handle, ready to assist with directions or provide refreshment at the campsites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to Zion National Park, and even with its hulking mountains and merry running river in the desert, it hardly holds a candle to Bryce.  It&#39;s a shame we didn&#39;t see it first so that we could appreciate the majesty there without the spell of the hoodoos....&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tales from the Tiki Bar:  The Universe Speaks!</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We should have listened!  We should have accepted the help offered after we had asked for help!  Duh! It was an awesome adventure that we missed out on, and it led to a low-level disaster.  There&#39;s an important lesson in serendipity here:  Don&#39;t swim against the tide -- just go with it. Isn&#39;t that what we&#39;re out here for?  GAH!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet and Facebook are awesome tools for a lot of things.  We needed a place to stay, it was generously offered, and instead of going with it and seeing what interesting people we could be with, we kept trying to be independent, looking for another campground and found it at the very last minute.  The new camp was a difficult path, and the serendipity path was easy.  Turns out we got offered a driveway, and she lived just south of where we were camped = Easy.  New campground was just a little too far to try to make it on time = Hard. We should have taken the hint from &amp;quot;the universe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=251489888201172&amp;amp;set=a.251489704867857.85034.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=251489888201172&amp;amp;set=a.251489704867857.85034.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already had planned to meet Kirby from Bryn&#39;s high school for breakfast  to discuss staying in her driveway a few days so nobody would feel stuck/obligated if things weren&#39;t going to work out.  Turns out we all hit it off, and it sounded like we would have had a great time if we stayed there. Kirby rocks! She was so much fun! We were a bit sorry we had found a place, but no, we didn&#39;t change our mind and stay. Instead, we hurriedly finished packing up and took off out of our camp trying to make it before the new campground closed for the night. Made it about halfway before we discovered our next blunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had taken off down the road with the main storage door open.  It had to happen.  We actually had congratulated ourselves that nothing bad had happened to us yet and said we still need to make that exit checklist. Yep!  Lost the main camper crank (the one the salesman told us not to lose!) and the stabilizer feet crank and some wood blocks for the feet and the two plastic wheel chocks. Stabilizer crank was easily replaced, but the main crank, not so much.  Going to have to special-order it from Jayco.  Hope we can even get it, since they changed the design.  Can&#39;t even talk to them till after Monday July 4. So we shopped and shopped and finally came up with a way to get the camper up, but it&#39;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were attempting to stretch our dollars by seeking help, but we ended up having to buy some extra tools and stay the night in a motel in Bakersfield and missed out on an adventure.  GAH!  Not only that, but we had to change our mind and delay that particular camp we were trying to make because we hadn&#39;t noticed that the temps were going to soar well over 100 for the next 5-6 days!  So here we go:  high-tail it back towards the coast over two mountain areas with our underpowered vehicle and heavy trailer.  We are waiting out the heatwave in a more expensive campground in kind of a nowhere place. Probably should have run right back to LA, hat in hand, and parked at Kirby&#39;s.  Double-GAH!  Hope we don&#39;t regret sticking ourselves here for a week.  No refunds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thank you, Kirby, for the kind offer, not even knowing really who we were.  You are an exceptional person, and I hope we get to meet again in the future.  As for us....I hope we learn to go with opportunities that present instead of just trying to press on and stick to a plan that&#39;s going bad on us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, where has Roxi gone off to?  We need for her to open the Tiki Bar!  To serendipity! Cheers, everybody!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Bryce Canyon</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/bryce-canyon/"/>
		<updated>2011-07-09T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/bryce-canyon/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we finally left the North Rim area of the Grand Canyon, we drove off of the Kaibab Plateau and over to Utah. We stopped for the night in Hatch in a nice little campground. Good prices and the most amazing bathrooms of the trip so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47856022112_fdabbb15d7_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before sunset we drove on into Bryce Canyon. On the way there we passed through Red Canyon, which has several smaller features and is a nice introduction to the area. We stopped for a few pictures, then drove on in. Once there, we drove up to a lookout point or two and hiked out to the viewing areas. The main roads are all on the western side of the canyon area, and you really can&#39;t see much of anything until you hike out to an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47850295972_53b7bf32e6_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really was a stunning view. Some areas were perfectly lit by the setting sun, others looked like they would be optimally lit at sunrise. But the hoodoos were rather mesmerizing. We began to look forward to actually getting down among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46986266275_30a0cb373b_h.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove out early and got a good head start on the day. Inspiration point was glorious in the early morning sun. Then we prepared for our big hike. And let me at this point say a little something about warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46986266395_36ad475e62_h.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs at many National Parks attempt to warn people about the dangers of hiking. A sign at the Grand Canyon even has a photo of a woman who ran marathons who died out there on the trails. I take all such advice into consideration and try very hard not to be one of those statistics. And yet when we hit the trails we are surrounded by people who seem to have completely ignored all signs. They have very little water, if any. They are in tennis shoes. They are often very overweight. And yet all of these people (as far as I know) seem to manage to make it back to the parking lot just fine. WTF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the signs are overstating the dangers? I don&#39;t think so. Just a few days ago two hikers surprised a mother Grizzly and her two cubs at Yellowstone. The Grizzly mauled and killed the male hiker on the spot. So one certainly needs to be careful out there. But we often feel a bit overdressed with our hiking shoes and Camelbak water backpacks and our daypack. But hey, at least we&#39;ll have food to throw at any bears we encounter. &lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/simple-smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any way, we left sunrise point and descended. It was a bit like stepping off of a spacecraft onto another planet. At every turn you got a whole new angle on everything in sight. The result of this was a bazillion photos. We eventually made our way to the bottom of the trail and took a snack break in the shade. Soon after we came to the final part of the trail, exiting the canyon. It was a series of steep switchbacks. Evidently they recommend this particular direction because this end of the trail has shade. Probably a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47112903344_56a2da5dca_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After surviving that trail, we drove down to the end of the park and hiked the Bristlecone Pine trail. Lots of crazy old trees out there. On the way back in, we stopped at several lookouts, eventually making our way back to the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46986358405_874e8b1aa5_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryce Canyon was great, possibly Glenn&#39;s favorite location so far! Below is a slideshow of all 150 or so images we didn&#39;t delete (a couple hundred didn&#39;t make the cut). Watch here, or click any image to see them fullscreen on Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tales from the Tiki Bar:  Awesome People</title>

		<updated>2011-07-09T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve had an interesting couple of days with our rig.  I say rig.  It&#39;s a rig to us.  But I digress.  Already.  Anyway, we discovered a leak under the kitchen sink.  Not a big one, but big enough to do damage if we didn&#39;t get it fixed right away.  We were getting ready to pack up and move from McAlpine Lake campground to near YOSEMITE -- yay!  Glenn investigated and determined where the little leak was and that he couldn&#39;t fix it. So we had to take a side trip to the nearest Camping World since we have a comprehensive warranty.  $50 at any CW takes care of it.  Called the place and they&#39;re booked and can&#39;t fix it for a few days, so we drive there anyway to see if we can get any action or even parts to try to DIY.  The desk guy said, oh, no, you have to take it to where you bought the camper.  Albuquerque, NM?  We can&#39;t do that.  So you want to talk to the supervisor?  Um, yeah.  Enter Max Hayes, the service manager and our hero!  He just jumped in and said, come on, let&#39;s take a look, pull it in over here.  We took off the outer cover and he looked at it and proceeded to send someone out to get some parts and fixed it himself in an hour and a half.  Charge?  $20.  Even.  What?  Are you sure?  Yep, $20.  Max Hayes at the Camping World in San Martin, CA!  CHEERS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This on top of another great experience the day before.  Our battery was acting kind of hinky like it might want to strand us somewhere when we least need that to happen -- like ANYtime.  Just a bit of hesitation when starting up.  So after leaving the beach in Santa Cruz we stopped in Scotts Valley, CA, at Batteries Plus to get their free battery test/evaluation.  Bryan Parker was ever so helpful.  He took his handy-dandy battery widget out there  and tested whatnot, showing us what was going on with the battery.  He got us a very reasonable-priced battery and proceeded to wrestle in the hot sun with our Montero, who didn&#39;t want to give up its battery.  He worked like crazy to get the problem solved and the new battery in and the connections all cleaned up.  A very personable and interesting fellow, we had a great conversation as he worked.  When it was finally extracted, we discovered a 4-year-old battery on its last legs.  We are glad to have met Bryan who gave us excellent customer service.  SAAA-LUTE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being on the road.  The people you meet tell the most interesting tales and are the real gems of a big trip.  There are still people out there who care what happens to strangers and go out of their way to just be nice.  &amp;quot;It&#39;s not my job&amp;quot; did not apply here, and we are oh, so thankful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we are ensconced in a wonderful camp 24 miles south of Yosemite, crown jewel of U.S. parks waiting for the weekend crowds to go home!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tales from the Tiki Bar:  Napa Valley, baby!</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Highway 29 from Napa to Calistoga will take you through a river of wine.  If each winery is a boulder, it&#39;s a rapid run of gargantuan proportions. The term &amp;quot;highway&amp;quot; is kind of a misnomer too.  It&#39;s a two-lane road winding through gorgeous wineries at about 35 mph. Sometimes it&#39;s just a long line of cars, but mostly it kept moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262594200424074&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262594200424074&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to run the road to the far end and start from there.  As we drove we made a list of places we might want to stop and taste.  There&#39;s even Old Faithful Geyser of California on the edge of Calistoga.  We decided to pass that one up in anticipation of the granddaddy of old faithful geysers at Yellowstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began the serious part of the jaunt at Calistoga, which is a cute town in its own right, full of shops and tasting rooms and a foodie&#39;s delight.  The public market/farmers market was in full swing.  Not large, but colorful, and everything from fresh turnips and flowers to arts and crafts and African woven baskets and fans to gourmet treats and even a pretty good trio of ladies singing and playing instruments.  Just behind them, a nice creek with a bridge and a local chocolate lab taking a nice swim to cool off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262589513757876&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262589513757876&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262589730424521&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262589730424521&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First stop was Chateau Montelena of &lt;em&gt;Bottle Shock&lt;/em&gt; fame.  It was a great movie with lots of &amp;quot;poetic license&amp;quot; involved.   We were told the book has the real story, so now I must read.  We shared a tasting of 5 superb wines for $20 there and ended up buying a bottle of red zinfandel to save for our 21st anniversary in September.  A tasting there includes your own private pour person instead of one person covering 10-15 people, and she was fun and knowledgeable. The grounds were beautiful, including a lake with a path to two gazebo islands with beautifully set tables to rent for occasions.  They had a large Coastal Redwood they planted in 1990 that was now about 150 ft. high, I think.  In about 500-1000 years it will be among the giants, if conditions are right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262592250424269&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262592250424269&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262590947091066&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262590947091066&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was next on the list, tasty burgers and fries at a quaint little place there in Calistoga.  Next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freemark Abbey winery.  We met a nice young couple tasting next to us who were fairly new to wine and this was their first winery.  The wines and conversation were lively between us and our pour person. (I just like that title I made up.  What are they really called?)  The best was a bonus taste of their dessert white wine.  A little taste of heaven trickling down your throat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262592993757528&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262592993757528&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hm, what&#39;s this, A Dozen Vintners next door?  We can get an overview of several boutique wineries in one place.  We&#39;re the only ones there and our host, Tim Mertz, was perfectly awesome!  The shared tasting was, I think, $10, waived if you purchase something, and off we went.  I don&#39;t remember how many wines, maybe eight -- or fifteen?  Who knows!  It was a delightful afternoon of wine and conversation.  We stayed there quite some time and left with a case -yes, case! -- of a nice sangiovese for 50 bucks (!) that was one of the last on sale.  Tasted it at the end so we know it was pretty good.  I hope.  Nexsht!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262593480424146&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262593480424146&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we ought to walk around a bit before going into the next winery?  The slow drive brought us to Grgich Hills Estate (not a drunken typo). The vintner was also involved in the &lt;em&gt;Bottle Shock&lt;/em&gt; saga.  It was very pretty and they had some nicely priced gift boxes and souvenirs and an exhibit about their famous wine.  We weren&#39;t overly impressed with the actual wines, good, not excellent.  Back out into the perfect summer day.  Are we done yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope.  Just &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to stop in at Folie a Deux/Napa Cellars where they make one of our favorites, *Menage a Trois.  *The shared tasting there was only $7, and they had samples of some really brilliant dipping sauces.  Yum!  Our pour guy there was fun too.  And we got double tastes of two wines, before-and-after glasses, one out of the newly opened bottle and one run through the Vinturi Red Wine Aerator.  We thought we could actually taste a slight difference -- but by that time, who really knows!  We spent some time on the parklike grounds among the grapevines with actual fruit hanging before taking off for home.  It was sunny, about 75 degrees, slight cool breeze, bright green grass, grapevines, blooming flowers and lavender.....aaaaaah, perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Napa Valley</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our trip to Napa Valley didn&#39;t start as we had planned. After leaving the wonderful &lt;a title=&quot;Park Sierra&quot; href=&quot;https://www.parksierra.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Escapee&#39;s SKP Park Sierra&lt;/a&gt; north of Fresno we made the long haul drive out of the San Joaquin valley and then north on I-5. We made the usual pit stops for gas and snacks and bathroom visits, and we made decent time. We were slowing down to make the last turn from Hwy 12 to Hwy 29 when the trailer brakes clamped down and caused the tires to screech. WTF? We took it easy until we found a place to pull over and I got out to inspect things. It wasn&#39;t pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently one of the wheels on the left side had overheated and the grease was oozing out and slinging everywhere. We had some choices to make. After some discussion and some online searching we decided to backtrack a bit and drive the trailer over to the Camping World in Vacaville and park it. After we did that, we holed up in a nearby Motel 6 for the night. The next morning we were at the front doors when Camping World opened for business and talked to the service department. They were very busy and would take awhile to get to it so we went back to the motel and packed and checked out. Regardless the outcome on the trailer, this particular Motel 6 wasn&#39;t worth extra nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we talked to a service rep and got the bad news. Evidently the bearings weren&#39;t quite done correctly at the previous Camping World and when they overheated they took out the brake system with them. Two of the brake pads were cracked in half. All of them had excess grease in the drum. We finally opted to replace the entire brake system, just to be sure. Unfortunately the parts would not be in until Wednesday, so we found a half-way decent hotel and booked five days. I guess there are worse places to break down than Napa Valley, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove north through the valley up to Calistoga and then began working our way back south, one winery at a time. We shared tastings in order to pace ourselves, and it helped to save money too as most of the wineries along the main road charge anywhere from $7 to $25 just to sip a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262588787091282&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262588787091282&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calistoga was having a farmer&#39;s market so we checked it out for a few minutes. An all-female group (&lt;a title=&quot;Sweet Burgundy&quot; href=&quot;https://www.myspace.com/sweetburgundy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sweet Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;) was playing acoustic tunes -- bass, rhythm and lead guitars. The town itself was just totally cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262588997091261&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262588997091261&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first winery was &lt;a title=&quot;Chateau Montelena&quot; href=&quot;https://montelena.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chateau Montelena&lt;/a&gt;. It is the quintessential winery, with a main building looking much like its European predecessors. Their claim to fame is their 1973 Chardonnay which beat the French wines at an infamous blind tasting in Paris in 1976. You can get the basics and a lot of good entertainment from the movie version of events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the full story in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montelena also has beautiful grounds, with a small lake and gazebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262590947091066&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262590947091066&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262591977090963&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262591977090963&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of acreage in this part of the state planted as vineyards is staggering. All of the valley floor and half the hillsides were completely covered, edge to edge with grapevines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262594457090715&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262594457090715&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stop was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freemarkabbey.com//index.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freemark Abbey&lt;/a&gt; winery.  It was one of the wineries which had participated in the Judgment of Paris, and the only winery entered in both white and red wine categories.  It didn&#39;t really fare that well, but we actually enjoyed some of their current selection!  We also met a couple who were having their first-ever wine tasting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262592993757528&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262592993757528&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we left, we decided to try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adozenvintners.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tasting room next door&lt;/a&gt;.  Nothing fancy here, no paths lined with stone walls, no chateau, just a plain little commercial building.  But they represented a dozen local smaller wineries.  The tasting was cheap, and since we did indeed buy some of their wine it was free!  The gentleman doing the pouring was Tim and he was a partner in one of the wines we tasted.  It was very nice, but out of our budget range.  What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; in our budget was an entire case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eagleandrose.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eagle and Rose&lt;/a&gt; Sangiovese on sale for $50!  Score!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262593480424146&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262593480424146&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stop was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grgich.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grgich Hills Estate&lt;/a&gt;.  Mike Grgich was the guy who actually did most of the work on the Chateau Montelena Chardonnay that won all the awards back in 1976, or at least that is the story.  I&#39;m sure the high-dollar Chardonnay he still makes is good, but we weren&#39;t wowed.  Very nice facility and staff though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262593703757457&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262593703757457&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last stop of the day was at &lt;a href=&quot;https://folieadeux.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Folie a Deux&lt;/a&gt;, makers of one of our favorites -- Menage a Trois.  Very interesting building, wonderful grounds, knowledgeable staff and good wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262596000423894&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=262596000423894&amp;amp;set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days of sightseeing in San Francisco we returned to the valley again, but I&#39;ll save that for another post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.262588720424622.87451.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On July 29th we left Napa Valley and drove up to the redwoods of Humboldt County.  Once you get near Humboldt Redwoods State Park you can take the scenic route dubbed Avenue of the Giants.  It is a two-lane road which winds through the edge of the forest, dodging giant redwoods all along the way.  Our destination was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ancientredwoods.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ancient Redwoods RV Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269345949748899&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269345949748899&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269345949748899&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269345949748899&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were there for a few nights we drove around the area, touring the sights and the trees.  The first day we hiked through a couple of trails, one leading to the three main trees which were deemed the tallest back in the late 1950&#39;s.  They were given simple names like Giant Tree and Tall Tree.  One of them, the Dyerville Giant, fell in 1991, a victim of another tree which was knocked down by yet another tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269354069748087&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269354069748087&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269356309747863&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269356309747863&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also visited the park visitor center and saw what is probably the first ever RV, the shell of which was made from a redwood trunk back in 1917.  The shell was attached to a Nash Quad chassis. You can read about Charles Kellogg and his Travel Log here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269346699748824&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269346699748824&amp;amp;set=a.269345169748977.88781.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we took a leisurely drive on a route recommended to us by JD, an Escapee we met at Park Sierra.  It starts off on the same road that leads to the Tall Tree trail, then continues on out to the coast, then north to Ferndale.  But I am guessing that it&#39;s been a few years since JD has driven this road, because it is a mess!  The dips and potholes and washed out sections were constant for miles and miles.  The first time I could really stop and enjoy the view was when we got to the Pacific Ocean.  The views from there to Ferndale were gorgeous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269971636352997&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269971636352997&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269973049686189&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269973049686189&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferndale is a quirky little town. There are dozens of quaint little Victorian homes, cemeteries on a hillside and a strange race that began there in 1969.  The Kinetic Sculpture World Championship race, to be precise.  Unfortunately the race is held in May so we won&#39;t be able to check it out in person, but we did visit the museum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269978146352346&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269978146352346&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269979746352186&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269979746352186&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home we did one last hike on the Drury-Chaney Loop trail. The next morning we headed to Klamath.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On August the first we took a recommended road to see some scenery. A fellow Escapee recommended it to us. It follows the same road that one takes to get to the Tall and Giant trees in the park, then continues on out to the coast. We already knew that the section through the park was a slow drive due to both roughness and lots of huge trees which force the road to wind around a lot. What we didn&#39;t know is that the road is pretty much just as rough and windy all the way out. Cell phones don&#39;t work out here. Hardly anyone lives out here. I discovered later that this region is called The Lost Coast, and is the most undeveloped part of all of California. I&#39;m not surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=272785119404982&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=272785119404982&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryn tells me that the views were terrific, but I will have to take her word for that because I was unable to take my eyes off the road for more than a brief glimpse here and there. Bulls Creek Flats Road is the name while still inside Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It changes to Mattole Road about a mile before exiting the park. The park section also includes some switchbacks as one is either climbing or descending a ridge constantly. The topography of this region is so crazy that both the Federal Hwy. 101 and State Route 1 avoid it by turning inland. I&#39;m not even sure who is responsible for the maintenance on this route. I suspect that the road has become lost too, considering the many potholes and sections where the asphalt has been washed out and never repaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269971636352997&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269971636352997&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road takes you through the small unincorporated communities of Honeydew and Petrolia and Capetown. I remember seeing a few places along the road with buildings, perhaps a gas station and convenience store, but this usually consists of an above-ground tank and old-school pumps. Most residents live in the hills, I guess. Supposedly almost 500 people live out here and many of them are completely off the grid. No kidding. Past Petrolia the road descends quickly to the ocean, where a nice long straight and flat stretch of road follows the coastline for a few miles. The beaches are black sand, and the view is very nice. We stopped for pictures and to just soak it in for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=272785372738290&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=272785372738290&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon we were climbing the hills again and on our way to Ferndale, which I guess, among other things, could be called the gateway to the Lost Coast. Ferndale could also be called quirky. Many of the houses here are Victorian in architecture, and two local cemeteries are on hillsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269974343019393&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=269974343019393&amp;amp;set=a.269971516353009.88935.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That by itself provides for quite a few interesting photographs. But every spring this town just goes completely nuts! That is when they host the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://kineticgrandchampionship.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kinetic Sculpture race&lt;/a&gt;. It started in 1969, when two artists built kontraptions with pedals and raced them down main street. It has since evolved into a three-day, 42-mile &#39;Triathlon of Art&#39; in which people pedal and push kontraptions over roads, across sand and mud and through the water. Fans follow along on bicycles. It is truly an event where participation and fun are valued above just being first. I dearly want to see this event some day, but we are here at the wrong time of the year. We did, however, get to see the museum! This building houses many past kinetic race vehicles. I think the photos speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race has now been replicated all over the world. See if you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_sculpture_race&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;find one near you&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Special Whale</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On August the 2nd, after bidding a fond farewell to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ancientredwoods.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ancient Redwoods RV Park&lt;/a&gt;, we headed north along the coast to our next destination. We had reservations at the Golden Bear RV Park near Klamath, California. We were also hoping to see a whale which had been hanging out in the Klamath River!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275994639084030&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275994639084030&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the route north, we stopped to see some Elk in a pasture. Bryn has this thing about seeing a bull elk in the wild. And we saw one! I&#39;m not sure Bryn will be pleased until we see one while we are out hiking, but at least this was fairly close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275982635751897&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275982635751897&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached Klamath we passed a portable electronic message board indicating that we would need to slow down at the river and watch out for traffic. This had to be due to the whale! We hoped we would be able to see it. When we got to the bridge, sure enough the traffic was slow and people were lining both sides of the bridge and looking down into the water. State troopers were patrolling to keep traffic moving. It was a bit of a circus! We decided to drop off the trailer and return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275990942417733&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275990942417733&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275994245750736&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275994245750736&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the park was less than a mile from the bridge. We had the trailer unhitched and set up within an hour and drove back to the river. It was amazing! The grey whale was slowly swimming around on the north side of the bridge, spiraling and flapping her fins into the air. The kids thought she was waving. Secretly, so did the adults. Then the whale would slowly swim back to the other side of the bridge and begin long, slow circles while regularly blowing huge plumes of mist from her blowhole. She spent a lot of time near the bridge, as if she wanted to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=276007875749373&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=276007875749373&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275983249085169&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275983249085169&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275989655751195&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275989655751195&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it isn&#39;t natural for whales to be this far upriver. When she first arrived in late June she had a calf with her. After a month her calf swam back out to the Pacific to join the rest of the whales which feed off of the coast, but the mother stayed behind. Scientists monitored her, and she seemed generally healthy.  They also tried to motivate her to go back to the ocean using underwater speakers to play killer whale noises, but it didn&#39;t work. The whale did provide quite a bit of tourism for sleepy little Klamath, a town with a population of 800. It is also home to the Yurok Tribe, who saw some significance in the whale&#39;s presence. One tribal member had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She would just swim back and forth right in front of you and at one point go like this, like she was waving at us,” recalled Janet Wortman, a member of the tribe and a partner in the Requa Inn bed and breakfast overlooking the river. “Silly me, I waved back. It was like she was there to see people. She went back and forth. It was almost like she was going, `Here I am, you guys. Can you see me?”&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that quote today, August 19th, when I did a Google search to see if the whale had gone back out to sea yet. Unfortunately, that did not happen. The whale beached herself and died at 4:19AM last Tuesday, the 16th. She was pulled on to shore and buried in tall willows after the Turok Tribe sang a song and said a prayer to send her to the afterlife, and scientists did a basic autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janet Wortman&#39;s great-grandmother&#39;s cousin, Fannie Flounder, used to tell a story about a whale in a river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She said when the whale is in the river, it means the world is out of balance ... things aren&#39;t the way they should be,” said Wortman. “Fannie said you all need to get together and pray and dance and beat your feet on the ground and that will tilt the earth back the way it is supposed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she was here, she gained much attention.  Federal, state and local agencies coordinated in ways not normally seen. People from all over came to see her. She was seranaded with violins and flutes, and kayakers swam with her. Boat tours stopped by on their way to the ocean. Maybe she was just a wayward whale looking for a place to die, but before she was gone she brought people together. How many of us can say the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275990029084491&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=275990029084491&amp;amp;set=a.275982045751956.90086.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two of our favorite authors are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prestonchild.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child&lt;/a&gt;. You may have seen the movie &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zuguide.com/#The-Relic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Relic&lt;/a&gt;&#39; which was based on some of their books. Douglas Preston has also written several non-fiction books which we love. Back in May of 2007 I stumbled across a book written by Douglas&#39; brother, Richard, entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812975596/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=selfservehost-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0812975596&quot;&gt;The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; ahvsxllnypvwxbzmklmr&quot; style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0812975596&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;. We were captivated and enthralled by these stories of people exploring vast acres of previously unexplored redwood forests and finding and climbing taller and taller trees. We began reading everything we could find about these trees, in print or on the internet. Scientists have found entire ecosystems living in the upper branches over 300 feet from the forest floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this was something we were fascinated by, we had no hope of actually seeing them until we began planning our RV road trip. As I began to look for more details it became apparent that the tallest trees for which a location was public were not actually the tallest trees any more. These scientists and enthusiasts were discovering new ones all the time! As a matter of fact, most of the 25 tallest trees were in undisclosed locations. My enthusiasm began to wane. Sure, we could still see massive Sequoias and tall Coast Redwoods, but the tallest trees would be off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late July while we were in California I began researching again and looking through my notes so we could pick a park to stay in that was convenient to the biggest trees. Most of the tallest trees were in undisclosed locations in Redwood National Park and Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It became evident that I would be unable to see them. The tallest ones we could access had once been the tallest of all, back in the late 1950&#39;s.  Now they weren&#39;t even in the top 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, however, one other way of measuring trees, and that is their volume. A couple of groves have been found where the trees may not be the tallest, but they are massive. One such area is the Atlas Grove in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. The tree named Illuvatar is there, the 3rd largest Coast Redwood (in volume). It has more reiteration (new trunks growing from the main trunk) than any other known tree. It basically looks like its own little forest. Three other trees in this park are in the top 10 of the largest Coast Redwoods. But like most big trees, the locations are being kept secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grove with the largest Coast Redwoods is the Grove of Titans in the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. The only &#39;official&#39; grove of these redwoods in the park is the Stout Grove, with the Stout Tree being touted as the largest. In fact, it is now only 28th largest! Four of the top 10 largest Cost Redwoods are in the Grove of Titans. And while its location is still officially undisclosed, others have found it and are dropping hints all over the internet. Some wish it to be fully open to the public, others want the park to put boardwalks around it and make it an official trail, like the Stout Grove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Stout Grove&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145310200/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Stout Grove&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/9145310200_60224cc046_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stout Grove&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent the possible disclosure, some are putting misleading information out there, including pins on Google Maps. While I was trying to decipher all of the clues I made a discovery. I found an actual map of the location of the Grove of Titans! We were scheduled to be there within 48 hours! I was so excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 3rd we drove into the park. Actually, we came in on the opposite side from where I had intended, but as it turns out this was the closest way in to the grove. We parked and headed out the appropriate trail, with me occasionally checking the map images I had downloaded to my iPhone. After a few false starts, we came to a spot and saw what &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been some large trees. It was difficult to tell, but the location matched the map. We waded through the underbrush no more than 300 feet or so, and there it was, a huge Coast Redwood. It was a mass of trees fused together near the base. It was the Fused Titan! We had found it, the Grove of Titans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Fused Titan&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9143087303/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Fused Titan&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2880/9143087303_45a6a6b5c0_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fused Titan&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;180&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Fused Titan&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145313678/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Fused Titan&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2838/9145313678_9f7e01eab5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fused Titan&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We marveled at its size. We took pictures. And then we consulted the map again, turned and headed toward the others. The next tree was the largest Coast Redwood known to man, the Lost Monarch. Somehow it was even larger than the previous one. Taking pictures is one thing, seeing it in person is quite another. And then the next tree, around a fallen giant, was El Viejo del Norte, with its signature &#39;claw&#39; extending towards the earth. Soon we climbed over another downed tree, or perhaps branch and found our way towards a large twin tree, fused near the base. But wait, it wasn&#39;t the one we were looking for. That was the NEXT tree, the Screaming Titans! This pair of trees have fused from the ground up to a height of 20-25 feet. Their combined mass is possibly larger than many others, but because they are not technically one tree they don&#39;t get categorized with all the rest. But at breast height they have a wider circumference than the massive Sequoia General Sherman!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a title=&quot;Screaming Titans&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9143084179/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Screaming Titans&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3736/9143084179_449367ae07_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screaming Titans&quot; width=&quot;576&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  We spent at least an hour wandering the grove, taking it all in. Surprisingly we were not the only people there that day! Fortunately, the other explorer is someone who had previously discovered the grove and was giving his brother a tour. He gave us some clarifications on how to get to the other large tree, Del Norte which was across the river. Although we eventually found it we weren&#39;t prepared for water crossings and decided that we had seen enough for one day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Sword Ferns&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145309554/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Sword Ferns&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/9145309554_7f7cecf4b8_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sword Ferns&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our trip is not yet over, I can&#39;t imagine that anything will be able to surpass the feeling of standing in the middle of some of the world&#39;s largest living creatures. I think it will be the highlight of our journey through America. Then again, in two days we will be in Yellowstone!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Exploring Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/exploring-prairie-creek-redwoods-state-park/"/>
		<updated>2011-08-22T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/exploring-prairie-creek-redwoods-state-park/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After our own big &#39;day of discovery&#39; with the Grove of Titans, the next day we moved on to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, home of some of the tallest Coast Redwoods. My hopes were not very high as the location of this grove is even more secret than the Grove of Titans. In addition, it is relatively easy to spot the huge misshapen behemoths that are the Titans when they are so much larger at ground level. In comparison, one of the tallest trees in the Atlas Grove is barely nine feet in circumference! Without our own expensive laser range finder or LIDAR unit it would be next to impossible to find this grove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did hope for a glimpse of the Arco Giant which was supposedly visible from the meadow in front of the visitor center. I looked, but I did not find. In the meantime we checked out some park maps and decided to hike some of the trails. We started with a nice little half-mile loop that was supposed to be a simple nature trail. Unfortunately it wasn&#39;t so simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277886715561489&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277886715561489&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing a small bridge, the trail was supposed to curve to the left then cross back over the creek again and lead back to the  visitor center. So we crossed the bridge and came to a sign which seemed to indicate that the nature trail went both left and right. I just assumed that perhaps the trail went a bit further than the map indicated so we turned left and marched on. The further we went, the more I began to notice some things. First, this trail did not seem to be as wide or well-worn as the other parts. Second, some downed limbs and even small trees had not been cleared from the trail. Third, we met no other hikers along the way. However, we did continue to see informational markers with various messages on them, so we continued on. Eventually we spied an RV on the other side of the creek. I knew that there was a campground over there, but I thought it was past the bridge we were looking for. Nevertheless, onward we pressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277889252227902&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277889252227902&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we concluded that we had hiked for a good mile and a half, perhaps two miles. I consulted the map again and discovered that the bridge we were looking for crossed the creek well &lt;em&gt;ahead&lt;/em&gt; of the camping area. We had flat out missed it somewhere. But rather than turn around, we decided to continue toward a bike trail that should have been just ahead. But it was not to be. The trail became fainter and more overgrown until it eventually just died out. It was an eerie feeling. We were deep in the woods, all alone. The large ferns spread up the hillsides among the giant hemlocks, the redwoods now conspicuously absent. We were wearing light jackets since the air was a bit cool and misty and the plants were shoulder high and sporting the occasional spider web, but inside we were drenched in sweat. We turned around for the march home. We tried one last shortcut at a spot where the creek was shallow and had just enough rocks and gravel to hop over, but there was no obvious trail there either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277888068894687&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277888068894687&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277888598894634&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277888598894634&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we retraced our route. I was more than a bit upset at the park for leaving this trail off the maps, yet not blocking it off at the entrance or somehow warning us off. But eventually we got back to the trailhead where we had first turned off, and that was when I looked at the sign from a different angle, and it all made sense. What had appeared to be a sign pointing right and left was actually a sign pointing down the trail and back up the trail in the direction we had originally come from. The trail we had taken actually had a signpost right in the middle of it, but the sign itself was missing. I&#39;m betting it said something like &amp;quot;Trail Closed.&amp;quot; To further confuse matters, we had entered the nature trail from a completely different direction than I had intended. I thought it proceeded counter-clockwise from my position when in fact we were taking the clockwise route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[NOTE: As it turns out, the trail we took is an abandoned section of what used to be a longer Nature Trail loop]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277889802227847&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277889802227847&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we went ahead and finished the nature trail. It was actually only one-half mile in length and took us back directly to the visitor center. After we got to the car, I changed shoes and I think shirts, then we had lunch on a bench and laughed at our stupid adventure. I decided I was done with trees for now, and we drove back to camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277890608894433&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277890608894433&amp;amp;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Oregon Coast</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On August 5th we left the California Redwoods behind and drove up the Oregon Coast. There were no national parks or big tourist draws, just nice scenery and lots of ocean views. We drove through Gold Beach and Port Orford. At Coos Bay we stayed one night at the Mill Casino RV Park and robbed that casino of $17.50 in winnings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279066408776853&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279066408776853&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we soldiered north again, hugging the coastline on Hwy. 101. We stopped for a couple of nights at Coyote Rock RV park behind Siletz Bay, on the river. We were invited to get in on the fresh crab action as someone knew someone down at Depoe Bay who had just hauled in a catch, but we declined. Besides, we have nothing to boil crab in, and these were big crabs! Dungeness. The next day we drove to Depoe Bay and had some awesome clam chowder at the Bay Walk Cafe. Actually, we ate their twice. The first time we got a small cup to go, then continued strolling the street. Later, after visiting the whale watching center and the rest of the shops, we stopped back by for lunch which included a nice bowl of the chowder. Delicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/TPXupV23zL8&quot;&gt;Bay Walk Cafe in Depoe Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279067005443460&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279067005443460&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also watched someone processing buckets of crabs. He had it down to a science, whacking the carapace off with usually just one blow, then tossing the body onto a stainless steel table. After he had about two dozen crab bodies on the table, still slowly wriggling in their death throes, he washed them off and tossed them into a large pot to boil. Fascinating. And yet having a job like that would probably be my worst nightmare...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279341648749329&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279341648749329&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day we drove back south of town and stopped at the Devil&#39;s Punch Bowl State Park. This geographic feature is just a large hole in the rocks which empties at low tide but fills with angry, swirling water at high tide. There are several small gift shops and a winery here. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dutchmanwinery.com/index.html&quot;&gt;winery&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; claim to fame is that all of their wines are fermented in open-top fermenters, with access to the sea salt air. Bryn did a tasting and liked their wines just fine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279342168749277&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279342168749277&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we continued south and saw a sign and exited the highway to do something we had been intending to do ever since we first got to the Pacific: see a lighthouse! The Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area is run by the BLM, so our Access Pass got us in for no fee. (side note: we have saved over $200 this year on that pass!) This lighthouse has been in continuous operation since 1873, even during a long restoration from 2005-6, which included new glass panes and ironwork and paint. Staff are dressed in period costume (late 19th century) and we got to climb the large spiral staircase to the top! My mom has always had some sort of fascination with lighthouses, so I made sure I got some pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279067718776722&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279067718776722&amp;amp;set=a.279066288776865.90807.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we said goodbye to the Pacific Ocean and headed east, back to civilization. We rejoined I-5 in Portland and headed north, entering Washington State and eventually settling in for a couple of nights at the Silver Cove RV park, anticipating a day at Mt. St. Helens.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Mt. St. Helens</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mount St. Helens was not on my original list of things to do or see in Washington. But as things turned out, it was a good stopping point on the way to Seattle. So hey, why not, right? I mean, it&#39;s a huge frickin&#39; volcano! So we parked for a couple of nights at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.silvercovervresort.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silver Cove RV Resort&lt;/a&gt; and took a day trip in to the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=271218176228343&amp;amp;set=a.271218136228347.89161.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=271218176228343&amp;amp;set=a.271218136228347.89161.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main visitors center is at the Johnston Ridge Observatory. In May of 1980, this was just another ridge, known as &#39;Coldwater II,&#39; and was being used by scientists to monitor the mountain, which had seen increasing seismic activity and steam-driven explosions. The location was 5.5 miles from the mountain, and was thought to be a relatively safe distance. David Johnston was stationed here for the USGS on May 18. At Spirit Lake, two amateur volcanologists had stayed behind at their own risk to take readings, and a local resident Harry Truman had refused to leave his Mt. St. Helens lodge on the edge of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=271218279561666&amp;amp;set=a.271218136228347.89161.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=271218279561666&amp;amp;set=a.271218136228347.89161.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 17, a convoy of 35 frustrated homeowners were escorted into the restricted zone to gather personal belongings. Another such convoy was scheduled for the next day at 10AM. On May 18 at 8:32AM a 5.1 magnitude earthquake happened one mile under the mountain. David Johnston saw the northern face of Mt. St. Helens, which had been bulging for several days, simply collapse. 1,300 feet of the mountain plunged into the valley below, the largest landslide in recorded history. All snow and glacial ice melted instantly and the water mixed with rock and ash began racing towards Spirit Lake. Johnston got on the radio to the USGS in Vancouver, Washington. All they heard was &amp;quot;Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!&amp;quot; Rock, ash and trees hit his position at over 500mph. His body has never been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two miles north of Johnston&#39;s position, a ham radio observer named Gerry Martin saw Johnston disappear and transmitted &amp;quot;The camper and the car just over to the south of me are covered. It&#39;s going to hit me too.&amp;quot; In all 57 people lost their lives to the blast that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landslide released the trapped gas which resulted in a huge explosion that flattened every tree within a 230 square mile area in 180 seconds. The flow of debris hit Spirit Lake and forced all of the water up into the hillsides. By the time the water returned, the new bottom of the lake was actually 100 feet higher than the previous lake&#39;s surface! To this day it still has no fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 25-foot wall of debris, the bulk of the initial landslide, raced down the Toutle River. It destroyed 27 bridges on its way down to the Columbia River, 75 miles away. The normally 40-foot deep channel there was reduced to 17 feet and had to be dredged just to reopen normal shipping lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our visit, we watched the movie at the visitors center and took a guided tour. Young Ranger Kelly was an excellent guide. Even though she was born eleven years after the eruption, she lost four relatives that day. The mountain has always fascinated her and obviously motivated her to study and learn about it. I guess by being up here for work and walking around every day, by being near the mountain, she feels closer to those who have gone on before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=271218612894966&amp;amp;set=a.271218136228347.89161.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=271218612894966&amp;amp;set=a.271218136228347.89161.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hiked the trail to a better view of Spirit Lake, then returned to our car. Like so many things on this trip, you simply can not comprehend the scale of the devastation and the beauty of the mountain without seeing it in person. We really enjoyed this little side trip!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On August 10th we departed from the Mt. St. Helens area and drove north to Seattle. It was our first time here, and our first time to see our old friends Angie and Rand in their home. We backed in to their driveway and set up the trailer which fit perfectly behind their gate. Urban incognito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were there we spent most evenings enjoying some fine dining. Rand even prepared his infamous pizza made from scratch twice! We also enjoyed some wine most evenings, as best I can remember. I still blame Rand for that one night, no matter what Angie says! &lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/simple-smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also did some sightseeing. Rand took us to a nice spot with a great view of the bay and city. He also took us to see the troll! No, seriously, a troll. Big sculpture under a bridge. I&#39;m still not really sure why someone would create such a thing, but it seemed to be a popular spot! And of course we went downtown to the Public Market, the famous place where people out in front of the fish stands take orders and toss them back to the guys behind the counter. For every one person placing an order, there are a hundred tourists standing around with their cameras waiting to get a picture. I was one of &#39;em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=273114556038705&amp;amp;set=a.273113942705433.89527.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=273114556038705&amp;amp;set=a.273113942705433.89527.197146780302150&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got to do something a bit out of the ordinary, an underground tour! We followed our tour guide through a maze of alleys and basements, exploring what was the original street level before the city raised the streets several feet. Bank vaults, massage parlors, brothels, wooden sewage pipes, speakeasies...in other words, all the cool places to hang out! It was all there. Very entertaining and interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Financial Update</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/financial-update/"/>
		<updated>2011-09-09T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/financial-update/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unlike some bloggers, we don&#39;t normally share a lot of details about our financial situation. Most who do are usually testing out various money-making schemes and then providing the details to their readers. And most of their readers are there in the first place because they want to learn techniques that will help them pay for their future travels. We&#39;re not that kind of blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re the old kind of travel blog, where we just share the things we have seen and experienced. Some of you are following along because you are friends and family or co-workers.  Others want to see if we can make it work, because you are also interested in retiring early and if we can make it maybe it gives you some hope. And still others of you are here for unknown reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do want to give you a small update on our finances for reasons I will detail shortly. For starters, we do not have any active, regular income. We quit our jobs and we are still several years from being eligible for pension or Social Security money. That is why there is a link at the top of our blog labeled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/about&quot; title=&quot;Our Crazy Plan&quot;&gt;Our Crazy Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Glenn has made a few dollars doing some travel writing, and Bryn has made even more dollars doing some scoping and proofreading and other transcription work. But all of that has been very sporadic. On the expense side we were not originally planning on buying an SUV or a trailer, so that set us back a bit more than our original plan, not to mention repairs, maintenance and gas. However, a timely (aka lucky) investment has helped to offset much of the extra expense, so all in all we are right about where we had initially projected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, our expenses will definitely drop next year when we stop paying for vehicle and RV insurance and gas and RV park fees. But we still need to find ways to make some money and offset our expenses for this crazy plan to work long enough so that the pension can kick in before we have to go back to a regular job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of that, Glenn has entered this blog into a little competition called The 1000-1000 Travel Blog Challenge&amp;quot; Basically it is an experiment to see if travel blogs can work their way up to where they have 1000 visitors per day and make $1000 per month. A fairly lofty goal, in my opinion, but it is certainly something that we would love to see in the long run. Just to give you an idea of the challenges ahead, so far we&#39;ve made exactly $0.00 from this blog! On the visitors side, we&#39;re doing a bit better. In August we had 522 unique visitors and 2,423 page views. That&#39;s still quite a long ways from 1000 unique visitors per DAY but at least we have some goals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reader, you probably won&#39;t see much difference. We may stick some ads or affiliate links over on the side but we certainly don&#39;t want to beat you over the head with such. We also might make some product recommendations if we think it is something that you might like, but don&#39;t worry about a bunch of ebook or membership site promotions. I hate that crap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s it for now. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Washington to Montana</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/washington-montana/"/>
		<updated>2011-09-12T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We finally bid farewell to Rand and Angie and packed up for our departure from Seattle. Before we actually hit the road, we borrowed some caulk from the garage and recaulked the main seam down the middle of the roof. It had developed a small hole and water tended to puddle right near this hole. Fortunately we have experienced almost no rain on the entire trip so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;This is how Glenn does roof repair!&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aR-zTcfqnH8/TmexY-34xZI/AAAAAAAABrc/9mwUaHNywkc/s640/P1150047.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;507&quot; height=&quot;381&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove south and then east on I-90. After passing through the Cascades we entered the great Columbia Plateau, a large depression where so much of the earth&#39;s mantle flooded out in great lava flows that the crust eventually collapsed downward. A massive earth-scale turning of the soil, if you will. It is now a semi-arid savanna full of grasses and shrubs. I was a bit surprised as it reminded me of parts of New Mexico. Not exactly what I was expecting in the great Pacific Northwest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crossed the Columbia River at a small lake created by the Wanapum dam near Vantage. Shortly after our crossing, we took a scenic turnout and snapped a few pictures of the river below. A bonus was the wild horse sculpture on a nearby hillside! We stayed one night in an RV park near Moses Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Vantage Bridge on I-90&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rUOv9gAaoxY/TmexdJql8iI/AAAAAAAABro/Z1FGnzaBUy4/s640/P1150068.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; height=&quot;389&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Horse sculpture&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bNcZZNlh5BQ/TmexfSsuETI/AAAAAAAABrw/zqWtS7VCtOc/s640/P1150075.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we packed again and took off, stopping after only 17 miles in Moses Lake itself. We got gas and breakfast, and upon returning to the vehicle I noticed that I had left the AC power adapter for the Coleman cooler on top of the Montero. Oops! Somehow it had managed to stay put. Disaster averted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;oops&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MsqS7mtOiJ0/Tmexg5bN8wI/AAAAAAAABpA/3XeUGHEMhtQ/s640/IMG_0544.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern Washington had another surprise for us, dust devils! And unlike most of these we typically see in Texas or New Mexico, these were tall rope-like funnels. They were very reminiscent of landspouts, just without the clouds above. At one point we saw several of these all in one area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Dust devil&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lH8nnWgVi2M/TmexjJaz1FI/AAAAAAAABr4/d8ZK-zEQBtw/s512/P1150081.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;384&quot; height=&quot;512&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Spokane we stopped to see someone whom I only knew only from the internet. Gregg Thurman was someone who introduced me to investing in options. He trades almost exclusively in Apple stock, so we share an interest in both investing and Mac gear. We stopped by his antique car restoration shop and he gave us a tour of his wonderful old cars, and his project Mustang/GT, as well as his awesome Ford GT, one of only 4000 ever made. We&#39;re both talkers, so Bryn ended up wandering around and taking pictures. We only stayed for a couple of hours and then took off to the east since our destination for the night was in Montana!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Bryn inspecting an antique&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-z7eqf5IdH1I/TmexmWhdEuI/AAAAAAAABsE/C09TpuOSw78/s640/P1150095.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Packard Clipper&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fySjTKtFQk0/Tmexse0KdzI/AAAAAAAABsc/I3gZIUb3rno/s640/P1150111.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Gregg and Glenn chatting&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HktwjwH4saY/Tmex0_ff7cI/AAAAAAAABs4/h_zIZ5Gf_f8/s640/P1150125.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Rear engine, with braces signed by many Ford motor sports luminaries&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-limfW5iJdsY/Tmex8K6_NGI/AAAAAAAABtM/pKq8xSQ0oUM/s640/P1150143.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Idaho had other plans for us. We managed to bypass a big traffic jam in Spokane by visiting Gregg, but while we were in Idaho, just after going through the 4th of July pass, we ourselves were passed by three different State Troopers in a big hurry. Unfortunately the 4th of July Pass is also the last exit for six miles. Soon we passed a trooper setting out flares on the shoulder, lights flashing. And then we stopped. Eventually Bryn went walking down the road, rounding two curves, but she still couldn&#39;t see what was stopping traffic up ahead. The word being passed back through the truckers was that a big rig had caught on fire. Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;0 mph on I-90&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xtBvPerBSJQ/TmeyD9qWwHI/AAAAAAAABrQ/ls1ph2QqyO8/s640/P1150207.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next hour we saw ambulances and wreckers come and go, and eventually we were moving again, slowly. Hope the driver got out in time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Looks like the entire cab behind the driver burned up&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-D0JqpgLsdLY/TmeyEz0yyjI/AAAAAAAABrU/WQu2R-enXgE/s640/P1150209.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were obviously much later getting in to camp than we had anticipated. We had no cell phone service so I didn&#39;t get the voice mail when the RV park tried to call us, but I later found Google Voice&#39;s attempt to transcribe it! LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;What kind of park???&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cATaROyARC0/TmeyGrk06kI/AAAAAAAABrA/M5qe073RLKQ/IMG_0545.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately we made it in long before they closed the gates at 10PM. I was tired enough that we even stayed an extra night, just to recuperate. But we made it to Montana!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So eventually we reached our destination in St. Regis and stayed there a couple of nights, catching up on laundry, rest, reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47090984924_20c479a3a9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Huh?&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then made our way to Deer Lodge, again staying two nights. Finally we drove south to West Yellowstone which we intended to use as a base for our Yellowstone explorations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47828356362_e5fcc69229_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Welcome to Montana&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered where the motto &amp;quot;Big Sky&amp;quot; came from. Obviously there are wide-open vistas here, but the same could be said for many places west of the Mississippi River. As it turns out, it started with a novel. A.B. Guthrie wrote a six-novel series of historical fiction on the settling of Montana, from 1830 to the beginning of World War I. The first novel of the series was sent to the publisher untitled. The editor read through it and the accompanying biographical notes and came across an exclamation from Guthrie&#39;s father when he first arrived at Choteau, Montana: &amp;quot;standing under the big sky I feel free.&amp;quot; The editor chose &amp;quot;Big Sky&amp;quot; as the title. And in 1961 Guthrie gave the state permission to use it for tourism, and the phrase has stuck ever since!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40913942303_405944aca6_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wheat&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32936213387_d433edd53d_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man&#39;s attempt to keep snow drifts off of the freeways&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The western half of Montana has a lot of mountains and passes. Once we cleared most of those we headed south for West Yellowstone. The drive was very scenic. Mountains with snow, valleys, plains, meadows. Not very many people.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We Arrive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove in to the Yellowstone area from the NorthWest. It was pretty easy to find our destination, the &lt;a title=&quot;Wagon Wheel RV&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wagonwheelrv.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wagon Wheel RV park&lt;/a&gt;. Ken not only checked us in but pulled out a map and gave us a thorough overview of the park and the town. He drew lines and circled and annotated everything, including recommended businesses and complete mileage logs for each loop. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but proved to be invaluable later. It would be difficult to find a better park manager than this guy! We set up the trailer and took a brief stroll through town. Things were pretty quiet — it was, after all, Sunday evening. Perfect! We love avoiding the crowds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Wagon Wheel RV Park&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cejvCCUpVNc/ToIINCwCnLI/AAAAAAAAB0k/zVYBRuMqKR8/s640/SAM_0126.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Explore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I would walk you through a daily blow-by-blow of when and where we visited, but for Yellowstone I am going to cover things by feature. Besides, I&#39;m writing this almost a month after our visit there and my photo dates don&#39;t seem to match up. So I&#39;ll just start with an overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Trying on hats at the gift shop&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ilne9Q_NGjM/TlsM_9RdfPI/AAAAAAAABW8/jTCTV9J7NlE/s640/SAM_0137.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of a Supervolcano? There is only one supervolcano area in the whole world that is on land — that&#39;s Yellowstone. Every 100,000 years or so these things go off in massive explosions. This is the kind of eruption that makes species go extinct. Unfortunately they don&#39;t go fully, permanently dormant. So the entire Yellowstone region is sitting on top of this volcanic area. That is why there are regular earthquakes and tremors and lots of hot water bubbling up everywhere. And every time the earth quakes the water pathways are diverted. Old springs and geysers shift or dry up, new springs and geysers pop up or become more active. It&#39;s enough to make the Park maintenance crew crazy I&#39;m sure! Note: Mammoth Hot Springs is currently 85-90% dry in 2011. I don&#39;t know if that will change, but keep it in mind when planning your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot Spots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you notice when approaching a hot spring or geyser is the smell. It&#39;s hydrogen sulfide, a.k.a. that &#39;rotten egg&#39; smell. It&#39;s not concentrated enough to be toxic, but whew! Stinky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Steam vent&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VqwWt5uU004/ToINeGJSMJI/AAAAAAAAB1Q/HLsBCWgcvlw/s800/P1150364.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the air is bubbling up slowly through water, you have a hot spring. You can find these all over the park. If the air flow is higher, you might end up with a geyser. Some geysers seem rather steady, but most oscillate. Some explode just a few times a year, others are very sporadic, and some go off on a regular schedule. It is rather surprising that &#39;Old Faithful&#39; still adheres to a regular schedule after over 100 years of observation. Many others are no longer active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Bubble bubble&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Aw10JKahfM4/ToIPo5cBxsI/AAAAAAAAB1k/99z-vFhAHBg/s800/P1150467.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Old Faithful&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-13Yz8wCYxTA/Tlx1kYzmSkI/AAAAAAAABX4/YIjZ50gKdEA/s640/P1150807.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have air coming up through mud, instead of water, you have a mud pot. The thick mud just bubbles and plops around. Very entertaining!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Mud pot&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pnQ0COYWExk/TmBlBdM2f7I/AAAAAAAABbo/qDTcaHwz_aQ/s800/P1150342.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there is plenty of non-heated water in the park as well. The Madison River is long and shallow and flat and a favorite of fly-fisherman. Most of the fishing occurs outside the park, but you saw guys in waders everywhere. The other main river is the Yellowstone, including the upper and lower falls and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. This river begins at Yellowstone Lake, the largest freshwater lake above 7,000 feet in all of North America. Most of the lake freezes three feet thick in the winter, except for along the northern edge where several hot springs keep it open or thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Elk at Madison River&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gocWVHgRrdI/ToJNDYIPjOI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/WuKvzKLjTZg/s800/P1150576.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Lower Falls&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JxY3fvwYIFo/TmQPBwMZ9jI/AAAAAAAABcs/h3Geg2eC51Y/s800/P1150607.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Crand Canyon of the Yellowstones&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wjIPbJa-KgU/ToJNXAojsKI/AAAAAAAAB2U/LvBwFYioQg8/s800/P1150595.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildlife&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average visitor to Yellowstone is going to see mainly three species of wildlife. One is the Osprey, which are plentiful. Unfortunately most people won&#39;t even notice them. Another is the elk, which are a frequent cause of traffic jams. The third is the bison, which are everywhere. Unfortunately we had already seen very good examples of each on our trip, so there really wasn&#39;t that much new wildlife for us in the park. Fortunately there are a couple of places in the park which have populations wolves and grizzly bears, so we headed for the east side to check out Lamar and Hayden valleys. Our first trip was rather uneventful. We saw a massive bison heard in the distance at Lamar Valley, but that&#39;s about it. We briefly scanned the Hayden Valley treeline but saw no wolves or bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Osprey nest&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_WJm-89_1jo/TmQRO6qZCxI/AAAAAAAABc0/kX8aHAaYDGQ/s640/P1150666.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I got a great tip from Kevin Sanders, a.k.a. &lt;a title=&quot;Bearman&quot; href=&quot;https://www.yellowstone-bearman.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bearman&lt;/a&gt;. He runs a tour guide service and is possibly more familiar with the park than anyone else, including rangers! He posted an update on his &lt;a title=&quot;Bearman&#39;s Yellowstone Outdoor Adventures&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BearmansYellowstoneOutdoorAdventures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned some wolves feasting on a carcass. We had missed them! But he indicated that they would probably be there again the next day, and sure enough they were! Unfortunately, they were WAY off in the distance, about a mile from the road. Our binoculars and camera zoom were insufficient for much detail. But we DID get a hot tip from one of the other wolf watchers. He said that just to our south a grizzly bear was munching on a carcass really close to the road! Soon we were in our car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Bison in Lamar Valley&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZGeq8Nm2eOM/TmQam_Dy7PI/AAAAAAAABdg/CFBC-tHC1i4/s640/P1150734.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we arrived there was a tremendous traffic jam. We parked in the first open area and walked down the road to where all the action was. And there it was! WOW that thing was close! We estimated that it was about 75 feet off the road. Normally it is NOT safe to be that close to a grizzly! Fortunately he was busy eating and was in a grove of trees so he felt protected. We took a lot of photos and video, but eventually the rangers pushed the crowds to the left and right away from the bear, ending any sort of good viewing. We were so excited to be able to see this beast from such a short distance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Grizzly Bear&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pDT6hgq0j3w/Tl21z-cUUjI/AAAAAAAABY8/M0X_xz83nhk/s800/P1160331.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to see all of these things in Yellowstone, you have to drive. You drive a lot! Most of the major features are on two main loops. The northern loop is about 70 miles, the southern loop is 96 miles. This doesn&#39;t include the roads in and out of the different exits, each anywhere from 5 to 30 miles long. In other words, there is a lot of ground to cover! You can see most of the main features from your car or by taking short hikes on well-traveled paths. You can also take long hikes cross-country, but just be sure to go in groups and take plenty of bear spray. Two different people lost their lives to grizzly bears this year, neither had any bear spray and one was hiking solo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;View from hill above the Artists Paint Pots area&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AKrVFeRHasQ/ToINonNzA9I/AAAAAAAAB1U/9k1I7kN0jNI/s800/P1150371.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in addition to the main features, there is also a lot of scenery. There are many locations in the park where it seems like you can see forever. Blue skies, green trees, brown grasses, water of blue and green and orange even! All of this makes for a lot of beauty to take in, so plan ahead and do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Madison River at sunset&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-waLC0vGwHp4/TlxntxG0tkI/AAAAAAAABXc/eLAA4vMr4gI/s640/SAM_0387.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first planned our trip, Yellowstone was on the map but neither of us thought of it as a highlight. I was more excited about the tall trees of California, Bryn was rather fixated on Yosemite. But Yellowstone got our attention and held it, its beauty and wildness proving why it was the World&#39;s first National Park.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the last day of August we packed up, cranked down the camper, hitched &#39;er up and took off for our final trip through Yellowstone. Our route took us almost directly through the middle of the park and out the east gate. We proceeded east all the way to Cody, Wyoming, about 130 miles away. We got into town and set up camp and then Bryn contacted Deb, a classmate from high school!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She jumped on her scooter and her hubbie Mike got on his Harley and they came over for a visit. The next day after they got off work we met up and went to their favorite restaurant in town for some great wine and excellent food! The next morning we packed up again and took off for northern Minnesota, via Montana and North Dakota!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Almost Canada -- Wyoming to Minnesota</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/canada-wyoming-minnesota/"/>
		<updated>2011-10-12T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On September 2, we finally left Wyoming and headed for northern Minnesota. The first night we made it as far as eastern Montana. On the way, we passed what is possibly the funniest high school mascot we&#39;ve ever seen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46964127125_5429d948fe_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46964129455_79426723ca_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, if your town is named Belfry, what else are you going to have for a mascot? LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Eastern Montana for the first night, then headed East in the morning. It was the first ever visit for both of us to North Dakota, another first in a long line of firsts for us on this trip! Also, we&#39;re evidently close to Canada..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47858261242_498542828a_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47858234382_39609ca94d_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve stopped at a lot of National Parks and Monuments on this trip. Almost all of them were planned ahead of time, but this one was a surprise -- Theodore Roosevelt National Park. It doesn&#39;t seem like much of a park, but is evidently popular for horseback riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46995126435_c370033a70_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;park sign&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47911100811_df359bb486_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;horsies&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Dakota looks a whole lot like South Dakota, without the Black Hills and massive sculptures of Presidents and native warriors. Not to be outdone, this state has the &amp;quot;World&#39;s Largest Metal Sculptures&amp;quot; which you can see by driving the almost 64-mile round trip of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enchantedhighway.net/&quot;&gt;Enchanted Highway&lt;/a&gt;. We opted out, but took a few pictures along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40943694463_cde768439f_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enchanted&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we passed the &amp;quot;World&#39;s Largets Holstein Cow&amp;quot; near New Salem, ND. Great for a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47120933624_80cbf49afc_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;moo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped for the night near Bismarck at a decent little park. When I went to switch the refrigerator from propane back over to electricity, I discovered a ton of red dirt had blown in while driving down I-90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we finally made our way to the home of Kat and Del Erickson in Warren, Minnesota. Check that out on Google Maps, but take my word for it -- the next thing to the north is Canada. We&#39;re way up here in the middle of NOwhere!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all the photos from this part of the trip here:&lt;/p&gt;

Since we were fairly nearby we veered a bit north and dropped in for a visit. We got to see their house, her husband Del&#39;s farm, daughter Jessica&#39;s family in Grand Forks, ND and much more.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I just really, REALLY love that old Louis Prima song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, we&#39;re back in Texas! I sometimes forget that not everyone is following along via Facebook and Twitter. But you really should! That is where you get the latest updates, the minutiae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I have not been very good at keeping up with the photos and travel tales. So many to do! But I have some ideas rattling around in my head about how to catch up and keep up, and we&#39;re gonna need it! Oh my, the plans we have....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I think you probably already know, we are planning on staying here for a couple of months. We will see my parents and brother, and we have lots of friends to reunite with and catch up on. Bryn is already planning a weekend with her bestest friend in the world for her friend&#39;s birthday. Big girls&#39; night out with the Jazzercise gang too. We also have friends everywhere from south Arlington to Denton to see again. Wine Squared, I&#39;m thinking of you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there&#39;s the work part. We&#39;ve emptied the pop-up, now we need to clean and sell it. We also have lots of camping crap to sell, and eventually we&#39;ll sell the SUV too. And then we hop on a plane with a one-way ticket to.......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&#39;s a good question, isn&#39;t it? Frankly it all depends. One part of our overall plan that has changed a little bit is that we are going to further increase our fun factor while reducing our expenses by housesitting! And so our next destination really depends on which housesitting opportunities work out first. Maybe Lake Chapala in central Mexico? And we probably have something lined up for Costa Rica in July or August. We get to use someone&#39;s house, and they don&#39;t have to worry about the house looking vacant. Pets get fed and walked, lawns get watered. It&#39;s a win-win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s all for now, stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those unfamiliar check out the amazing Louis Prima and his crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013AJBK6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013AJBK6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=selfservehost-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anywhere In Texas, RFD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Leopold Center -- Baraboo, Wisconsin</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/leopold-center-baraboo-wisconsin/"/>
		<updated>2011-12-05T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/leopold-center-baraboo-wisconsin/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bryn has always loved nature and wildlife. As a child, she thought nothing of picking up a skunk by the tail and bringing it home for a pet. (Strangely enough, her mother let her keep it!) In high school and college she developed an interest in herpetology and had quite a succession of snakes as pets. It was quite natural, therefore, that she fell in love with her first copy of Sand County Almanac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Sand_county_almanac.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-832&quot; title=&quot;Sand_county_almanac&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Sand_county_almanac.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;198&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This book by Aldo Leopold made quite an impression on her. Aldo&#39;s writing was captivating. He is generally considered to be one of our nation&#39;s first environmentalists. His work in science, ecology and forestry was seminal. Eventually, Bryn would graduate from Texas A&amp;amp;M with a degree from the Wildlife and Fisheries department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She still had this book when we married in 1990. When I eventually got around to reading it, it was an eye-opener. It jolted my understanding of things  as simple as what &#39;nature&#39; was. I had generally viewed wide swaths of ranch and farm land in Texas as natural. Sand County Almanac revealed the hidden history of land use to me. It was difficult to picture what the original prairie grasses and trees might have looked like to the original pioneers who arrived, but this book caused me to try. It also sparked in me a love for wildlife, birds in particular. We still have this book, although I&#39;m not sure it is going to make it to South America with us. However, I have always remembered his description of the dusk skydance of the woodcock, but perhaps his most memorable words were reserved for the sandhill crane when he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some day, perhaps in the very process of our benefactions, perhaps in the fullness of geologic time, the last crane will trumpet his farewell and spiral skyward from the great marsh. High out of the clouds will fall the sound of hunting horns, the baying of the phantom pack, the tinkle of little bells, and then a silence never to be broken, unless perchance in some far pasture of the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Sandhill Cranes in the wild&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OJgp7B5HNgY/Tq6EQux4EXI/AAAAAAAACsc/yu1RhY_3Fx4/s1024/P1160433.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;717&quot; height=&quot;403&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Leopold began his own wildlife restoration project near Baraboo, there were only 25 pairs of nesting Sandhill Cranes left in the entire state of Wisconsin. To this day I am unable to read that passage out loud without getting a bit choked up. Such is the power of the words and imagery of Aldo Leopold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly before we left on our RV journey in April of 2011 we found out that a new documentary about Leopold would be shown in Farmer&#39;s Branch. Green Fire was a great overview of Leopold&#39;s life and work, and a nice sendoff for our trip. It also made us aware of the Leopold Center in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Another pin appeared on our trip map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;The Leopold Center&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eXh_rErlZBI/Tq6ErYAy0BI/AAAAAAAACdE/ibZ75htwFDQ/s800/SAM_1021.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on September 12th we arrived. We spoke with the volunteers manning the center&#39;s front desk and wandered around the facilities. We admired the form and function of the buildings and its zero-carbon footprint. We learned from a display that Leopold now has only one remaining daughter. We also discovered that the center provided bicycles for the short trip down the road to Leopold&#39;s old cabin. Bryn was rather insistent, so we took the ride and strolled around the cabin, trying to imagine what it would have looked like back in the 1935 when Leopold acquired the land and began one of the nation&#39;s first ecological restoration projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Bryn enjoying the ride&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i6tKTgYowZU/Tq6EXvoxaxI/AAAAAAAACcY/Zq6_Fo9wFTk/s1024/P1160460.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;573&quot; height=&quot;323&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soaked it in. We walked to the river&#39;s edge through deep sand. We hiked through the trees. Bryn spent time sitting on a small bench in front of the shack. I used the outhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Bryn soaks it in&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZSLQ450bjbw/Tq6EUFmHv1I/AAAAAAAACsw/wYLFtISPgD4/s1024/P1160445.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;717&quot; height=&quot;403&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. I could write forever and never describe this place adequately. Kenneth Brower, however, wrote eloquently about the shack and Leopold in 2001 in the Sierra Club magazine, and I could add nothing to his eloquence. Give it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200101/leopold.asp&quot;&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt;. You won&#39;t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the full album of photos:&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read this from a Facebook friend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wish for everyone in 2012 - &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2011/12/fireworks.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
12 months of happiness&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
52 weeks of fun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
365 days success&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
8760 hours good health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
52600 minutes good luck&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3153600 seconds of joy !!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Happy New Year&#39;s Eve Hugs !!! ♥&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{: style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2011/12/bored-baby.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;{: align=&amp;quot;left&amp;quot; }&lt;br&gt;
Sounds nice!  But I started thinking about it:  8760 hours in a year.  Not all that many when you think of a whole year.  How many do I just WASTE of my LIFE?  This is my most important asset we&#39;re talking about here:  MY LIFE!  Only one time around, no do-overs.  How much time do I spend these days just sitting in front of my computer basically doing absolutely nothing?  Not fun, not productive, just nothing; boredom?  That just totally SCARED me!  I&#39;m no spring chicken anymore.  Can I afford to just throw that many hours away?  Trash.  Nothing.  Can I?  Can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought, well, you have to subtract 8 per day for sleeping/staring into space/hoping to sleep, and it&#39;s only 5840.  Then you have to spend, say,  1.25 hours in the bathroom a day:  5384.  Then there&#39;s time eating/cooking/cleaning the kitchen and dishes, say 2 hrs a day:  4654.  Over a whole year, I only have about 4654 hours to LIVE.  That&#39;s only 12.75 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2011/12/old-celebrate.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;{: align=&amp;quot;right&amp;quot; }&lt;br&gt;
When I get to my death bed (presuming nothing sudden happens early), will I say, Wow, I sure wish I&#39;d worked more hours, spent more time playing computer games, spent more time in virtual space doing whatever, spent more time just &amp;quot;resting&amp;quot;?  No I will not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO....I hereby apologize to myself for all my wasted time in this one life I have been allotted -- apology accepted -- and I resolve to spend my time more wisely.  I wouldn&#39;t just flush dollars for no reason, would I?  No, I wouldn&#39;t.  Life is so much more valuable than money.  You can always make more money.  You can never make more life or more time.  Spent is spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAPPY NEW LIFE, EVERYBODY!  What will you do with this year?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Musings On Being Homeless after 7 Months</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/musings-homeless/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-03T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/musings-homeless/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Homelessness on purpose is a pretty freaky feeling.  We, like you, have always had a lot of stuff.  We had a small house that eventually seemed a bit cramped.  We moved closer to our good jobs and bought our dream home with the vow never to move again.  We bought the house we thought we&#39;d retire in, in a nice neighborhood.  It was big enough for us and overnight guests and party gatherings.  We filled it with stuff that attracted us.  I never threw things away or got rid of very much that I really could have/should have, just in case I might need it later.  Then came the epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not where we want to be in 10+ years when we retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#39;t want to be tied down anymore with debt and a mortgage.  We had been thinking about retirement for a few years and what we wanted to do &amp;quot;someday.&amp;quot;  We got the freedom bug and the travel bug, and all we&#39;d collected over our 20 years together started to seem a huge anchor around our necks choking the life out of us. We were getting emails at work about people that retired 1, 2, 3 years ago and now they&#39;re dead -- come to the funeral.  Is that our future?!!  We have living to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about others that went before us into the world at large inspired us to take action to get out of the &amp;quot;American Dream&amp;quot; system.  We took drastic measures to kill off all our debt and stuck to it.  We started selling off all our stuff.  Hard watching all my beautiful stuff that I paid good money for going out the door for pennies on the dollar, but we had a dream.  I was telling everyone about how we were leaving so that I couldn&#39;t chicken out.  I didn&#39;t want to be all talk and no do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the day came when we left the world of having an address where we live.  We have almost no personal belongings.   I&#39;m a woman; women &amp;quot;nest.&amp;quot;  My nest was gone and I must fly free.  It&#39;s liberating yet kinda freaky and unsettling.  I have to remind myself when I &amp;quot;look down and see the ground far below&amp;quot; that my stuff is now in the bank.  That&#39;s my nest egg, if you will.  I realized that the only real security in having stuff is that you could sell it if you needed money.  We sold it already.  That&#39;s the only difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have pictures of all my stuff if I ever want to look at them -- so far, not. Seems that having a lot of stuff is just what we do to give ourselves the illusion of permanency in the world or having an anchor. I haven&#39;t regretted any of this except for maybe a few kitchen items that we had to replace with cheaper versions when we got our travel trailer.  That&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I LOVE BEING HOMELESS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can make much less money since there&#39;s no bills and no maintenance, other than our vehicle that will soon be gone.  Breathing is easier without that &amp;quot;load on my shoulders.&amp;quot; Downsizing to two backpacks is the next step as we head for adventure in the world outside our previous experience.  New languages to learn, new food to try, new people and cultures to explore, new friends, new vistas, new sunsets.  Nope, not regretting it at all, thank-you-very-much.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Glenn 2.0 -- 2011 in Review</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/glenn-2-0-2011-review/"/>
		<updated>2012-01-08T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/glenn-2-0-2011-review/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Early in 2010 I looked ahead to my 50th birthday and tried to come up with something appropriate for the end of my first half-century of life. That&#39;s a pretty big milestone, and I wanted to celebrate in a big way. At one point I wanted to go to a big music festival somewhere in South America, but was unable to line one up with my birthday. And by the time we finally decided on the day we would quit our jobs, I was unwilling to spend the money for the flights. So we kept things low-key and celebrated with a meal at a Hibachi Grill restaurant, and an evening at Wine2 with Klara from Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are, a year later, and once again we kept the celebration low-key. Philip and Shelley came over for burgers. After that, Philip and I wasted some time letting 12-year-olds kick our butts at Modern Warfare back at his place. We also watched a movie with the wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet in spite of all these low-key subdued birthday celebrations, I&#39;ve had an amazing year! I think it has easily been the most amazing year of my life so far. What better way to start the second half-century? And in that spirit, here are some of the many amazing things I can recall from this last year when I close my eyes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record snowfalls in north Texas in February -- dubbed the &#39;Snowpocalypse&#39; -- work shut down for an entire week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://scontent-a-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/t1.0-9/s720x720/397822_360784547271705_1741345993_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;405&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving work. Being able to spend all day, every day doing what I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do, instead of what someone else requires me to do. Priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t1.0-9/383642_359487184068108_1724472585_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeless and living in our car. Having a lot less &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; to deal with is very liberating. Mental energy and time freed up substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://scontent-b-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/t1.0-9/p180x540/384506_359487870734706_1998519645_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geology and Geography. Volcanos, canyons, lakes, rivers, waterfalls, oceans, coastline. Arches, hoodoos, mud pots and lava flows. Impressive and awe-inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living things. Massive and soaring trees. Bison, wolves, bears, elk, whales, condors and cranes. Forest and grapevines and food crops to the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manmade landmarks. The Golden Gate bridge. Hoover Dam. Classic city skylines. Foundations and ruins of two grist mills in Ohio owned and operated by my ancestors in the early 1800&#39;s. Many Dixon headstones in cemeteries from Ohio to Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing people. The traveling kids from France. The wonderful staff at the Ancient Way Cafe and Campground. The birders at Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge. Bryn&#39;s high school classmate from San Bernardino. Cass and Jim in Napa Valley. Angie and Rand in Seattle. Deb and Mike in Wyoming. Kat and Dell and Jessica in North Dakota and Minnesota. Jim and Mila in Chicago. Bryn&#39;s sister Athlynn in Michigan and her cousin Sue Greene in Ohio. My cousins Dave and Debbie in Iowa and Laverne Beam in Kansas. DeeAnne and Park in Oklahoma City. They took us in, they wined and dined us. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad&#39;s 80th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 States&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20,000 miles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that, and doing it and seeing it with my soulmate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://scontent-b-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/t1.0-9/s720x720/396189_359488480734645_624560794_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;405&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many that would be an entire lifetime&#39;s worth of memories! And yet for us, it is only the first year of (hopefully) many to come full of travel, adventure, amazing sights and people. Thank you for following along with us, and here&#39;s to a great 2012. I hope it is wonderful for all of us!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The International Crane Foundation -- Baraboo, Wisconsin</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Of all the things that Aldo Leopold wrote about, I was most interested in his observations about birds. He is possibly most well-known for the things he wrote about Cranes. In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/776/leopold-center-baraboo-wisconsin/&quot;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; on our visit to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aldoleopold.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aldo Leopold Center&lt;/a&gt; I quoted Leopold&#39;s famous Marshland Elegy about Sandhill Cranes. We saw a few of these amazing birds on our way to the Center that day. But a day later we saw all fifteen Crane species in one place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://savingcranes.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Crane Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is located less than seven miles from Aldo Leopold&#39;s famous shack. The two founders met at Cornell and one of them grew up birding on Leopold&#39;s property. The Foundation breeds cranes in captivity to repopulate the species, especially the whooping crane, which at one point was down to 22 birds in the wild. They also work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://operationmigration.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Operation Migration&lt;/a&gt; to reintroduce migrating flocks to Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures we took when we visited back in September, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Photos coming soon!]&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been a wonderful few months with family and friends, but we are about to move on to Phase 2. That&#39;s the part where we leave the United States! It took a lot of research and discussion but we finally got it all set. We are going to start in Mexico!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of good reasons for this. For one thing, we&#39;re familiar with Mexico, having last traveled there back in 2008. For another, it is where we were able to get our first housesitting assignment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven&#39;t been following along on Facebook, we&#39;re flying to Chapala, Mexico to begin housesitting on February 15. We will be taking care of a house, two dogs and two cats for awhile. Our only expense will be groceries and entertainment! We&#39;ll be free to do some daytrips and see some local sights. Free WiFi, a car available for short trips to the grocery store or bus stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have a friend of a friend who lives down there who we can meet, and we are hoping to meet up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://retireearlylifestyle.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Billy and Akaisha Kaderli&lt;/a&gt;, if they aren&#39;t tromping around Central America by then. We&#39;re looking forward to exploring the lake and the small towns around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have sold the tent camper, now we just have to sell the Montero and then figure out how to cram all our stuff into our backpacks. That can&#39;t be too hard, right?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>You Crazy or Sumpin???</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/01/crazylady.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello World, Bryn here, ready to dish out some truly mind-blowing drivel. Maybe I am just a bit on the odd side....  Anyway, here goes.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryn, how did you, the shy, follow-along, go-with-the-flow girl end up in the wacky place in life you are in now? A bit, uh, risky, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Oprah, dear, it&#39;s like this... (I can dream, can&#39;t I? LOL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my life I have just zinged along, doing what was expected of me by people around me, by the societal circle I was dancing in, never really questioning anything, taking the collective word for most things -- fa-la-la!  I&#39;ve really pretty much lived a charmed life.  Not much hard ever hit me over the head.  Things pretty much came easy to me, as expected.  Yeah, I had a few failures, but nothing bad really happened:  Failed marriage, failed career path.  Big deal.  I lived to start anew, just going with the flow.  I actually ended up in my 40s way better than I ever imagined.  I found the right husband and life partner/companion, and I went to school again and got a freaking amazing job with a freaking amazing paycheck to go with it.  Life was good.  Got the dream home, decent cars, friends to party with, job I actually loved with a paycheck I really loved. The good life, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retirement started getting closer and closer, and our dream retirement is something we&#39;d always thought about, off and on.  Retire to Belize.  Retire to a nice travel trailer and tour the country.  Retire in our dream home right here.  Different things at different times.  Then there was the epiphany, the ah-haaaaa moment.  Actually, it was a process, but it&#39;s more fun to just say, Ah-haaaa! &lt;em&gt;light bulb&lt;/em&gt;  Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started reading blogs about people that retired early to travel, either in country or abroad, and it sounded interesting.  Then we decided to take a little vacay in Mexico, dip our toe in the water, see something different.  It changed my entire life, my entire brain, how I perceived the world around me, how I perceived my whole existence.  Literally, one day I was X, X, X, X, and X; the next few weeks I migrated to now I&#39;m Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y and Y, and Z too.  Actually, some of that process had already started and was plugging along at an alarming rate, had I paid attention instead of just adapting and not really noticing.  Basically, I suddenly felt like I&#39;d been lied to my whole life about everything I thought was the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; way to think, the way everyone around me in my circle of influence thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mexico brought it all out in front of me to see.  Not sure why travel doesn&#39;t do that for most other Americans, but it did for me.  Maybe it&#39;s because we didn&#39;t go to a tourist spot where English is spoken or stay in resort areas.  I don&#39;t know, whatever.  But it changed me from the roots up.  I started to question what my circle of life had always told me was right, white-bread Republican, Christian, American... I started to question it all and actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the other side to all those opinions, not just dismiss them as crazy ideas held by wackos. &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;  I was now able to take those other points of view and hold them up and examine them and see that both sides of the card held good and bad and that neither side held the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; answer after all.  But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the point of this post, right?  What was it, again?  Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we &lt;em&gt;raving lunatics&lt;/em&gt; for leaving our house, selling all our stuff, quitting our perfectly wonderful, well-paying jobs to be homeless bums -- uh, Vagabondians! -- at large in the big, bad world?  Why would seemingly normal people living a pretty darn good life ever DO THAT!??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There came the point when we realized that we were busy doing the same thing day in day out, week in week out, year in year out, and that nothing was changing.  None of it really mattered.  We were just marching along in the sheep line to our eventual slaughter at the end, making a dying instead of a living, so to speak.  We weren&#39;t particularly unhappy, but we were not going to be satisfied with that, doing what all normal people do, arriving at our death beds (should we make it that far) and saying, &amp;quot;Well, I had a decent life.&amp;quot;  We realized we were going to be thinking:  Oh, the things I coulda, woulda, shoulda done instead of just be a cog in the big American machine.  I  coulda, woulda, shoulda done exciting things, things that mattered, things that might have made a difference to someone. There&#39;s only one go-round and this was it.  Is this all there is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO, NO, AND  NO!  &lt;em&gt;SUUUU-LLAPP!&lt;/em&gt;  Get the hell out of the sheep line!  Now!  Live the life you want, and do things, see things, try to help some other people along the way.  Make a life that matters.  It&#39;s not too late!  Envision the dream life and then get out there and LIVE IT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/01/live.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will we miss the security (real or imagined) of our jobs, our home, our stuff?  Will we hate traveling?  Will we hit the hard pavement with our faces, come up bloody, and have to admit defeat and end up badly compared to our former lives?  Maybe.  I think not, though.  So far it&#39;s been freaking amazing, but we&#39;re still in the in-between yet, still extracting ourselves from our former life to embark -- quite soon now -- on a completely different life.  We aren&#39;t jumping completely without parachutes, flimsy as they may be, but we are jumping.  Really, what&#39;s the worst that can happen?  Can it be overcome?  Is it worth a shot?  YES!  So if that makes me monkey-slinging-poo-CRAZY, then I guess I am.  But I have to try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How&#39;s your life panning out?  What are your dreams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you even know what your dreams are or what you really want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What holds you back from what you really want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is life just passing you by or are you truly happy?  I hope you are truly happy.  If you aren&#39;t, it&#39;s never too late till the proverbial singing happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I help you?  Questions?   Comments?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>One More Week Until Mexico</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you had only one week left in the country you were born and raised in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what we&#39;re going to do -- work! Looks like we&#39;ll be able to fit our stuff into our Rick Steves carry-on bags, but there are a lot of little leftover pieces and parts. So today is eBay day!  We plan on heading to Denton on Friday. Glenn will be seeing some old co-workers for the first time in a long time, and we are trying to work in a few other people as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up renting a car which we&#39;ll drop off at the airport when we are ready to depart next week. Our homeowner sent us a few car parts to take with us, so we&#39;ll have one bag to check, which gives us a bit of extra room for miscellaneous items if we can&#39;t fit them in the overhead bags. Speaking of bags...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture you see attached to this article is from 2008. We packed for our trip to Mexico using two bags each. One overhead, one under the seat. All carry-on, no checked bags. This time we&#39;re doing the same thing (not counting the checked bag of car parts) but there is one major difference between now and 2008 — this time we&#39;re not going for ten days, we&#39;re going for several months! Basically, this is everything we own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, enough chit-chat -- time to get busy!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Well We&#39;re Leavin&#39; on a Jet Plane…</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/leavin-jet-plane/"/>
		<updated>2012-02-18T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/leavin-jet-plane/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’ve been so busy over the last few months that I don’t think I’ve had the chance for all of this to sink in yet. Living in a ‘foreign’ country for a few months really isn’t that earth-shattering. Millions have done it before, and millions will do it in the future. I try to look at it that way. However, if you add the fact that we will continue to do this for the foreseeable future, with only occasional trips back home, our adventure becomes much more unusual!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we flew from DFW to LAX in Los Angeles, and then on to the Guadalajara airport, I made some notes. Here they are, rather unfiltered, a bit of a raw travelogue, as it were. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-far%2C-so-good!&quot;&gt;So far, so good! &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#so-far%2C-so-good!&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On board the plane, waiting for everyone else to board. Busy flight. PACKED! The last people getting on right now are being forced to take their overhead bags to the back, or they are having to scour the bins for a spot where they can cram their bag in somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having given up our phones and having cancelled our cell data plan with Millenicom, I miss being able to pop in to Facebook and say silly things like “Hey, we’re getting on the plane now!” I’m not sure &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the world will live without my live play-by-play commentary of such momentous occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/2gYukUF&quot; alt=&quot;I&#39;ve looked at rainbows from both sides now&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather forecast was for scattered showers and a potential for thunderstorms, but it looks like we managed to luck out so far, at least on the D/FW Airport end of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few stragglers are wandering around in the aisle, to the point where an attendant announced something to the effect of “We’re ready to go to Los Angeles, just as soon as you idiots in the aisle will sit down!” The last one seems to be a problem child – “UHRL crew” on her t-shirt. I’m lookin&#39; that one up later!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also had someone who evidently got on board without properly checking in. The attendant announced “Would the passenger in 25B please identify yourself by using the call button.” They asked a second time. I swear they said the passenger name was Atta. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTF???&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Finally an attendant had to come back and talk to them. He took their boarding pass up front, and evidently everything was fine. No Air Marshall was called upon. &lt;em&gt;Whew!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as soon as we got in the air we were above the fog bank lying on top of the D/FW Metromess. We’ve passed a few storm tops, but nothing severe so far (15 minutes in) and only occasional minor turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/2gYumF5&quot; alt=&quot;clouds from above&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just had to scold Bryn. They announced that the movie was starting, so we plugged in our earbuds. We got a short preview, then a blank screen for several seconds. Bryn said “They hijacked the movie!” entirely too loud. I pointed out that she might not want to say the word ‘hijack’ on an airplane…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So – the movie was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_Call&quot;&gt;Margin Call&lt;/a&gt;” – interesting, very slow-paced. Not sure what I think about it exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels a bit strange, this floating in the air. I’ve flown enough that it doesn’t feel new any more, but not enough that I don’t still marvel at the fact that I am 38,000 feet above sea level and looking down at mountains. That part still feels quite foreign, unnatural. I can certainly understand those who might eschew flying for ground transportation, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Madden#Fear_of_flying&quot;&gt;John Madden and his infamous bus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy next to me must be a Mac fanboy like myself – he put an Apple logo sticker over the Dell logo on his laptop! LOL He calls this a ‘Dapple.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/2gYun9j&quot; alt=&quot;backpackin&#39; it&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAX was crowded. No seats available anywhere! Finally parked against a wall like backpackers and grabbed a couple of burgers. First celebrity sighting – &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Della_Reese&quot;&gt;Della Reese&lt;/a&gt;. She came through on her scooter, an assistant in tow. Straight through to Virgin Airlines. Must be nice…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alaska Air was much more proactive than American in controlling carry-on luggage issues. They asked if they could take our overhead bags and check them for us. We ended up leaving them at the end of the entrance ramp. The main difference on this leg was the seats. Much nicer than American! For most of the flight to Guadalajara you could see the Pacific Ocean out the right-side windows, then later the Baja Peninsula. Finally made it to Guadalajara airport. Surprise of surprises, our two checked bags from LAX &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; our main checked bag from DFW all made it just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, immigration was quick and easy, customs not so much. We got ‘selected’ for an inspection. It was rather painless, didn’t take too long. We only exchanged $100 at the airport due to the poor exchange rates their, but we needed the pesos for the taxi. You pay at the booth and get a receipt. You take the receipt to the curb and only authorized cab companies will take that for payment. Our taxi driver was friendly, but he knew less English than we knew Spanish (which isn’t saying much) so there wasn’t much conversation. It was just as good, because we were tired. We forgot to print out our housesitting address/instructions so he drove with my laptop in the passenger seat. I had the instructions pulled up from an email, worked great. At long last we were deposited in front of our casa and got to meet Fiona, the housesitter we’re replacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More initial thoughts on Mexico coming soon! Here are the first set of photos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It already seems like a lifetime ago that we left the United States. And yet it’s only been two weeks. If you are fans of our Facebook page, you’ve seen the many photos we have posted. However, in case you missed it, here are some of our favorites, and a few stories along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;The view from our patio room&quot; src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/419375_10151301706635437_648515436_22943655_1812741369_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;403&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we last left you, we had just arrived at our housesitting assignment. We’ll try to catch you up now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona was our predecessor, and fortunately she was able to stay with us a couple of nights while we got acclimated to everything and settled into a routine. She showed us the route the dogs normally took on their twice-daily walks and introduced us to all the neighborhood animals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucy, the horse who will trot over for carrots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oso, the German Shepherd mix who seems to guard his casa all alone, and who is starved for attention. We always give him a treat and throw a toy for him, if he will let us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gus, the loving pit bull&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layka, the German Shepherd who jumps the wall around her house to follow us home for a treat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Lucy&quot; src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/429301_10151367535090437_648515436_23182823_725836151_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;576&quot; height=&quot;432&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Fiona spent a couple of weeks in town, meeting us several times for errands. She showed us where Pablo never shows up to work on cars, and then where the Goodyear is where people actually do show up to work on cars, and cheaply! She showed us the apartment in town which we need to check on occasionally. She showed us the store where we need to pay the rent, and the store where we need to pay the security company fees. That one required walking through what appeared to be someone’s living room and through a courtyard. She showed us where we pick up the raw meat and vegetable mix for the dogs, and where the coffee vendor usually parks, and where the different weekly markets are, and where the bank is. Whew! I can’t imagine finding all of those places without her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Where we pay rent&quot; src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/405949_10151324364665437_648515436_23018551_1374992794_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; height=&quot;691&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding violence in Mexico, well, there’s good news and bad news. Let’s go over the good news first. The bandidos who were robbing some of the homes in the neighborhood appear to have moved on to new targets, or were perhaps arrested. They were typically hitting homes near the main road, so none of our neighbors were particularly worried about that issue. The bad news is that last Saturday night a car was spotted hanging out in one area overnight. Neighbors talked to them, and they claimed to be security hired by the neighborhood. They said this to people who knew better, and who proceeded to call the President of the neighborhood association. But before any official response could be mustered, they did what they had come for and left quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently one particular person in a remote corner of the neighborhood was known for some shady dealings. Federal police had visited his home a year earlier, and there was an incident involving dogs and a colt several months ago. It would seem he pissed off the wrong person as someone shot him in the head while he was leaving his home Sunday at around 10:45am. We are assuming this involved the car which had been hanging around and claiming to be security, but no details have come forth. The neighbors seem to be shrugging it off, as it was a very targeted attack and the target is no longer with us. And if those living closest to this house aren’t worried, then we certainly aren’t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police were already patrolling the neighborhood regularly, but we’ve seen a LOT of them over the last few days. Fortunately we’ve got a very alert dog and an alarm system and a house and car that would, frankly, disappoint any criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cars, the old Volvo 850 (viejo rojo as Bryn calls it) has been quite the handy thing to have. After Goodyear replaced the control arm and I rigged the seatbelt to work it has reliably taken us to stores and markets and parks. We’re old pros now at quickly recognizing spoken amounts of pesos and producing the correct change. Today Bryn tried on and purchased some nice leather sandals from a vendor at the mercado in Ajijic. We also managed to take Ruby to the vet for some flea treatment and shots and then to the Malecon on the lake for some walking around. We also had dinner that night at the same location. Note to self: ‘whole fish’ means exactly what it sounds like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;el Viejo Rojo&quot; src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/426776_10151304268655437_648515436_22950478_1039076354_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;403&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving in Mexico isn’t too much different than driving in the United States, with a few exceptions. Traffic signs and road markings are more of a suggestion than a rule. Pass when you want. In town, no need to wait for an invitation -- if you have left a car length between you and the car in front of you, don’t be surprised to see someone pull into it. They will expect you to slow down, and you will. The same for pedestrians. The gas stations are owned, staffed and operated by the government. And just like Oregon, they will pump your gas for you. Unlike Oregon, they will also wash your windshield!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Fiona moved into town she and Bryn were invited to a party by some neighbors! We had a great time. Jean-Pierre and Yolanda were wonderful hosts. We had burgers and chicken and several great unique pastries and other dishes. The guests were a true cross-section of the area. Expats from the United States and Canada and local Mexicans. At any given moment you could hear conversations in English, Spanish and French! It was a great way to get to know our new neighbors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;It&#39;s a party!&quot; src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/423870_10151320568040437_648515436_23008248_2128755659_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;403&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I almost forgot! We celebrated our first official Mardi Gras in Ajijic! It was on Fat Tuesday. In pretty much every country south of the U.S. this time of year is generally referred to as &#39;carnaval&#39; and not Mardi Gras, but it&#39;s the same pre-Easter celebration. Well, not exactly the same. No breasts were exposed, but there were a lot of men dressed up as women. And instead of beads, they throw flour -- as in, throw it all over you! It was a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;I need to be de-floured&quot; src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/418814_10151339947625437_648515436_23076595_788364297_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;403&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that will do it for now -- I’ll leave you with wonderful song about Mexico from James Taylor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Oh, Mexico

It sounds so simple I just got to go

The sun&#39;s so hot I forgot to go home

Guess I&#39;ll have to go now&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

		<title>Mañana in Mexico</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/manana-mexico/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-23T18:00:00-06:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just some rambling, random thoughts on our new home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that you hear often about Mexico is &amp;quot;mañana,&amp;quot; the concept that everything takes longer in Mexico. While there is some truth to this, much of it is probably due to a Mexican resistance to gringo impatience and arrogance. Back in the 1980&#39;s there was a big migration of people from the steel and auto industry in Michigan and Ohio who moved to Texas for jobs. Popular bumper stickers at the time said &amp;quot;Love NY? Take I-35 N&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;We don&#39;t care how you did it up north.&amp;quot; Yankee immigrants were perceived as rude and bossy, opinionated. I suspect that Mexicans may have similar thoughts about Norteamericanos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal control. That&#39;s handled a bit differently here. On the road to Ajijic, called the Libramiento, there is a dead horse. It has been there for three weeks at least. It was evidently hit by a passing vehicle and has been lying in the roadside culvert ever since. Once it began to stink, someone put a thick layer of quicklime on it. They added more when it started to stink again. I don&#39;t know if there is a governmental department anywhere assigned to collecting animal carcasses or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we visited Guanajuato in 2008 a man would come down the alley way once or twice a week yelling &amp;quot;GAAaaaaaaaaaAAAASSSSSS!&amp;quot; at 5:30AM. It might have been later, but it seemed very early. But Guanajuato is an old town with many areas accessible only by very small cars or on foot. Now that we are in a slightly newer area (something built since the early 1600&#39;s) there are trucks for gas delivery, and there are two or three different companies. But the delivery notification is much the same. The trucks drive down the street and if you need some gas you stop them and get some. You can tell which company truck is coming by the musical ad playing on their loudspeaker, like an ice cream truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of loudspeakers, it&#39;s quite popular to place them on top of your car here. Then you can rent yourself out as a rolling advertisement. It seems to be used mostly for events. You get a tape or CD of the ad, then you drive around playing it through the speaker you have strapped to the roof of your car. We even had one drive through our suburban neighborhood advertising a circus in town. Unlike most ads, it played in both Spanish and English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways the pace here is, indeed, a bit more relaxed. And since I am trying to fit in, that&#39;s my excuse for not writing more. Mañana.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Medicine in Mexico</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/medicine-mexico/"/>
		<updated>2012-03-27T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/medicine-mexico/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been asked, What will you do if you get sick or need a doctor?  You&#39;re in MEXICO, for heaven&#39;s sake!  Oh, horror of horrors!  Their health care can&#39;t possibly be trustworthy!  Or can it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, our plan is, if we need to, we&#39;ll go to the doctor here.  We don&#39;t have any insurance.  We&#39;d rather (to borrow a quote) pay for what IS instead of what MIGHT BE.  Here in Mexico and most all the other countries we plan to visit over the next several years, it&#39;s actually possible to pay for your care out of pocket!  Really! (more on that later)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/405036_10150776629948993_677503992_11483150_2097365987_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purposely avoided going to a doc before we left the States, since we really couldn&#39;t afford (translate:  didn&#39;t want to pay exorbitant prices for) a doc visit and medicine for a little infection under my toenail.  So after we got settled, I chose a doc from a local expat forum and went in.  He was a very nice young doc, excellent English, took a good history, did a basic exam, and sent me for blood work.  He says I&#39;m supposed to be immune to this type of infection.  I think he already knew what my blood work was going to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/522774_10150776630493993_1473331998_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;609&quot; height=&quot;504&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took his order for tests around the corner to the lab where a couple of lovely, friendly ladies who really didn&#39;t speak much English took my blood and payment and told me to pick up the results the next day after 2:00.  I have fainted in the US from lab techs digging the needle around to make it go into the vein and I had the bruises to show for it. But this tech was so good that I was surprised to hear a hissing sound and had to turn and look to make sure that it was my blood filling the vial!  So much for my needle phobia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the doc with my results:  Yep, diabetes!  WHAT???  He gave me my instructions and prescriptions to go fill at the farmacia. (Oh, boy, I hope all the forms are in English!)  I went into the Farmacia Guadalajara (the Ajijic branch), gave the lady my RXs, she went and got the boxes, I paid and left.  No red tape, no paperwork, no bother, AND very inexpensive medicine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, then the liver tests came back and the doc requested I come in to go over treatment plans.  Oh, great.  Now what?  After a consult/discussion, he sent me to Guadalajara for a CAT scan of my abdomen to see why my bilirubin numbers are so high.  He said I could go locally for an ultrasound, but it would be better to examine all the organs.  He called for me and made the appointment, gave me the order complete with map, and sent me on my way. Hm, wonder what this will cost!  But it has to be less than paying outlandish premiums and meeting a very high deductible, then 20% like back home, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/525669_10150776631003993_677503992_11483157_1551424664_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;440&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the big lab in the big city I went in and the tech scared the living crapola out of me -- for no reason.  I think it&#39;s the English/Spanish thing.  Partly.  (And my absolute phobia of medical procedures since being traumatized by The Exorcist at age 11.)  He said, &amp;quot;We have to put in your vein medicine to paint the organs and it will be hot, uncomfortable, but for a short time.&amp;quot;  I took that to mean that my arm was going to burn off as I groan and writhe and fight tears.  (Okay, this is going to be BAD -- suck it up!)  Then they said I needed a full bladder, so I had to drink 4 cups of water down.  Then she came back and said maybe some coffee would speed it up, so I drank 2 cups of Nescafe, then two more glasses of water to wash that out of my mouth as I nervously waited.  The ocean in my gut!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the tech gave me a clean cotton gown (nice long, wide one that covered very nicely, thank you very much!) and I went in and laid on the plank with a pillow.  They put a foam thing under my knees, stuck a needle in my arm (hardly felt that either!), and hooked it up to a drip.  Arms overhead and they left.  So far so good -- no fire -- and in I rolled, under the arch.  Back and forth, hold your breath, out again.  I didn&#39;t feel anything go into my vein.  She came in and checked my needle and put my arms on my stomach and told me to relax and left for a few.  Still didn&#39;t feel anything.  I started giggling when I though about relaxing though, and wondered if I was high.  I didn&#39;t think so -- dangit!  Then she came back in, put my arms back over my head in a slightly different position and left, and in I rolled again.  This time I did feel some heat, but it was in my abdomen, and it was just a weird warmth.  No fire down my arm!  Yay!  Then I was done.  I&#39;m to pick up my results at the cashier window in one hour.  That&#39;s it?  Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/557649_10150776631458993_677503992_11483159_555700202_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;621&quot; height=&quot;464&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole experience was great.  I simply went in (we were about 45 minutes early), showed them my slip from the doc, they looked up my appointment, I paid.  I waited maybe 15 minutes, went in, drank all the liquid, had the procedure, out, get results, leave.  No pages of paperwork to fill out  here either!  Really!  I got all my CT Scan films and a CD, and they email the doc with the results too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From reading other travel blogs, I was ready for the building to be kind of shabby, and in the US I would not have set foot in it.  But they put their money into cleanliness, good modern equipment, and professionalism instead of fancy, costly buildings.  Same with my personal doc.  He&#39;s just by himself  with his computer in his consultorio on a cobblestone side street.  Fine with me!  I don&#39;t like paying for the unnecessary fancy accoutrements found everywhere back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this, I had a reaction to the dye with my meds, so to stop feeling awful and drained, Dr. Loza sent me to the farmacia to get IV supplies to take to the clinic in Ajijic to have them administer it.  Walked in with my stuff, they took me to a little room, and a nurse hooked me up and came back now and then to check on me.  Her English was excellent as well.  She was also very good and didn&#39;t hurt me when putting the catheter in my hand.  I&#39;m going to have to be over having a needle phobia now -- it&#39;s just silly!  The clinic always looks busy from the outside, but inside was clean and nice and there was no waiting -- and, once again, no red tape and paperwork!  Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so here&#39;s the bottom line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|---&lt;br&gt;
| Initial office visit/doc consult and history: | $500 pesos/ $38.99 USD&lt;br&gt;
| Lab work: complete blood workup: |  $750 pesos/$58.49 USD&lt;br&gt;
| Doc consult office visit: |  $300 pesos/$23.39&lt;br&gt;
| Farmacia Rx: |  $29 pesos/$2.26 for 60 days&#39; worth&lt;br&gt;
| Lab work: complete liver profile workup: |  $700 pesos/$54.59&lt;br&gt;
| Doc office visit on liver, sent to get CAT scan: |  $ zero pesos&lt;br&gt;
| Doc regular office visit/consult/exam: |  $300 pesos/$23.39&lt;br&gt;
| Big city lab CAT scan: |  $4,500 pesos   $355 USD&lt;br&gt;
| Doc consult on CAT, sent for IV: |  $300 pesos/$23.39&lt;br&gt;
| Farmacia:  IV bottle, tubing, needle catheter: |  $106.30/$8.29&lt;br&gt;
| Other Rx: | $245.90/$19.18&lt;br&gt;
| Ajijic clinic to administer the IV on a bed for 1 hour + B12 vitamins I forgot at pharmacy: | $450 pesos/$35.09&lt;br&gt;
|===&lt;br&gt;
| &lt;strong&gt;GRAND TOTAL&lt;/strong&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;$7,681 pesos/$598.97 USD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, my friends, is less than one month of insurance premiums for one of us, had we been paying them!  And I have in my hands the originals of all the blood tests and CAT scan in case I want to review them, look up something on the internet, or go have a second opinion.   No muss, no fuss, sane and logical here in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>April Fools?</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/april-fools/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-01T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two years ago today Bryn and I walked away from our house and moved into an apartment in Denton, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year ago today Bryn and I left that apartment and became officially homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then we have driven thousands of miles and slept under the stars of half of the states in America. We have seen snow-capped volcanos and deserts, massive canyons and oceans, dust-devils the size of small tornadoes, lava formations stretching as far as the eye can see, dust storms that blocked all visibility, smoke from forest fires that blotted out the sun, cliff dwellings thousands of years old. We have driven through ghost towns that pass in the blink of an eye and cities that stretch to the horizon. We have hiked miles and miles of trails, some of which were first walked thousands of years ago. We have seen the largest trees known to man and been bitten by bugs so small as to almost be invisible. We watched a whale saying her last farewell, and a grizzly hungrily gnawing on a carcass. We watched condors, once almost extinct, gracefully ride thermals as they rose from the Grand Canyon walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tasted wonderful food in remote desert houses, in small cafes and in bustling city markets. We saw famous and busy places and landmarks, and we saw remote stretches of trail with hardly another soul in sight. We moved slow, we took it all in, and in return we stepped into a different realm. It sometimes seemed as if we had stepped off of the racing escalators and instead took the stairs. So many rushing by, in such a hurry, glimpsing what they could quickly, seeing and not understanding, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have crossed into another world. We are the minority. The words we hear, the signs we see – all are meant for others. It requires a mental shift, an adjustment. And yet we do not feel like too much of an outsider, rather welcomed. We connect with fellow travelers, we forge friendships with other cultures. We learn. We grow. Our minds are opened, and expanded. Our lives have been changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought it appropriate that we left behind all vestiges of a permanent residence on the first day of April. We are doing what many would call foolish, after all. But sometimes what one might see as foolish is, instead, truly wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are guided by many who have gone before. I will close with this inspirational quote from Everett Ruess, an explorer &lt;button data-balloon=&quot;He also disappeared and his body was never found!&quot; data-balloon-pos=&quot;up&quot;&gt;ahead of his time&lt;/button&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/04/Everett-Ruess.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Everett Ruess&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adventure is for the adventurous.&lt;br&gt;
My face is set.&lt;br&gt;
I go to make my destiny.&lt;br&gt;
May many another youth be by me inspired to leave the snug safety of his rut, and follow fortune to other lands.&lt;br&gt;
-- Everett Ruess&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>I Feel the Earth ~~ Move ~~ Under My Feet</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/feel-earth-move-feet/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-11T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/feel-earth-move-feet/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I guess it was bound to happen eventually, but I&#39;m a little surprised as to just how totally unprepared I was for my first earthquake. Sure, earthquakes are always a surprise, I get that. But it was nothing like what I thought it would be. I expected I would hear rumbling and rattling and feel lots of vibrations, like riding the old Texas Giant at Six Flags in Arlington (before the recent renovation). Instead, it was nothing like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, April 11, 2012, Bryn and I were both sitting down and working. She was at the dining table, I was on the couch. The first indication I had that something was different in the world was an unusual sensation. I was leaning forward and typing on my laptop when I suddenly felt light-headed and I could feel my pulse strongly. The throbbing caused me to feel like the room was moving, when it was obviously just something internal. I felt something like nausea, or vertigo. I sat up straight and took a deep breath. The feeling eased a bit, and then it came back. That&#39;s when Bryn said &amp;quot;Why is the house moving?&amp;quot; And that&#39;s when I said &amp;quot;Oh shit, it&#39;s an earthquake!&amp;quot; We both went out the front door and stood in the street behind the car. Another wave hit and we watched the wrought iron fence gently wave back and forth. I saw one of the utility poles sway slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire time that it lasted there was no noise. No rumbling, no rattling. And the movement wasn&#39;t jarring either. The whole world simply rocked back and forth several times, just enough to induce queasiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quake occurred at 5:55pm central time. The epicenter was about 100 miles away down near the Pacific coast, about halfway between Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco. The initial estimate was that the quake measured 7.0 on the Richter scale, but that was later &lt;a title=&quot;USGS&quot; href=&quot;https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usc00090z0.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revised downward to 6.5 by the USGS&lt;/a&gt;. Mexico City is 240 miles from the epicenter, but tall buildings swayed (without damage). Later that night, just after midnight, two other quakes occurred farther north, near the Baja peninsula. If you add the recent quake further south, the whole Pacific coast of Mexico is being pretty rumbly with four quakes stronger than 6.0 all within a three-week period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/earthquake.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone  wp-image-1138&quot; title=&quot;earthquake&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/earthquake.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that I remember saying something not too long ago about wanting to be in an earthquake, just so I could say I had. Obviously I did not intend to be in anything too strong, so yesterday&#39;s quake met my criteria admirably. Having said that, I&#39;m good for now on earthquakes. Give me some good old safe tornado chasing any day!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Life and Living in Mexico</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/life-living-mexico/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-17T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/life-living-mexico/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One month (well, almost two since I started this post and never finished it!) under our belts living in a foreign country, here in Chapala, Jalisco, MX.  The time has flown by.  Somehow I thought that the days would seem longer, that I would have so much time on my hands to get things done.  Not so.  Of course, I&#39;ve been mentally chained to my computer way more than I planned.  Just one more email check, a little more Facebook reading, one more game.  Then it&#39;s time for the dogs&#39; afternoon walk, dinner.... That&#39;s got to change!  Glenn is using the time here to get his internet business going.  A lot of learning, trying things, changing things, on and on.  Couldn&#39;t do much of that when we were touring the US and seeing all those national parks and whatnot.  Here in our four-month house sitting job, maybe he can get it knocked out so he can get into maintenance mode before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately -or unfortunately, depending- we can get by here in Chapala/Ajijic with very little Spanish.  I finished my Fluenz Spanish 1 &amp;amp; 2, and it&#39;s an awesome course.  I highly recommend it.  I wish I had 3-5, but it&#39;s more money than I want to part with now that we don&#39;t have jobs.  The people here are very patient with us and very kind.  Many people here speak English to some degree and love to practice.  Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fluenz.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fluenz for Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and other languages too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groceries and shopping seem to be the biggest problem for me.  It takes forever, and I never buy enough to last, and I don&#39;t have enough easy recipes.  The food is different here, and I don&#39;t know what to do with a lot of it.  We like to get almost all of our veggies and berries at the tianguis, or open air markets, here.  Monday&#39;s in Chapala, that we just discovered, is really huge and offers so much.  We have been going to the organic market on Tuesday and the tianguis on Wednesday in Ajijic.  Seems still, every time I go, that I have a what-the-hell-is-THAT moment for some fruit/veg thing on a table or two.  Alien stuff, whatever your definition of alien!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;alignleft  wp-image-1144&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_0135.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/1094/life-living-mexico/img_0140-2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-1146&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-1146&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_01401.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to find a butcher and find out where his meat comes from and hopefully get mostly grass-fed now.  Chicken here is all yellow -- and I mean primary color/rubber chicken yellow!  For all I know, this is normal and the chicken in the US is bleached.  I need to learn!  I want to get away from American beef with all the antibiotics and the &amp;quot;pink slime&amp;quot; in almost all the hamburger and the other questionable practices of big ag.  I think the dozen or so cows by the market were for sale, and the pen did not smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our house-sit, we are to walk the big dog twice a day and the little dog once a day, so we get our exercise going up and down the many hills in this neighborhood on the rough cobblestone roads.  The maid comes on Monday and Friday (love this perk!), and the gardener comes weekly (or he&#39;s supposed to).  So it&#39;s been a fairly busy schedule with just basic living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather is about perfect so far, and when we go down to Chapala&#39;s malecon (walkway by the lake with a market on weekends, restaurants, beach, boat rides...), it&#39;s really nice.  Lots of interesting people to watch too.  Ajijic also has one that is beautiful, but newer and not as active on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s the skinny.  More to come.  Don&#39;t worry -- I&#39;m going to start writing more often and shorter articles with more pictures.  This isn&#39;t cutting the mustard, so to speak!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Day Trip!  Tlaquepaque/Guadalajara</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/day-trip-tlaquepaque-guadalajara/"/>
		<updated>2012-04-22T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/day-trip-tlaquepaque-guadalajara/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our friends in the neighborhood, Jean-Pierre and Yolanda Luisser, French-Canadians from Quebec, invited us to join them on a day trip to Guadalajara on Sunday, March 25. Oh, boy! A trip to the big city with someone who knows where to go and what to see -- and most importantly, how to drive in that crazy place! So we set out about 10 in the morning, first stop Tlaquepaque, a town on the outskirts that I first heard about on The Travel Channel long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/526280_10150842926778993_677503992_11703252_2078959908_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;548&quot; height=&quot;411&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We parked in a parking lot with a shade, a big plus, and walked in. There’s a main drag with lots of art work installed in addition to all the art and wares set up in doorways and down the sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/545696_10150842929348993_677503992_11703272_817768460_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height=&quot;727&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/562625_10150842930948993_677503992_11703285_598043878_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;551&quot; height=&quot;413&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came to a little courtyard where some artists had their tables set up with all kinds of really interesting things. An artist carving little buildings and streets from wood to intricate jewelry made of paper to painted ostrich eggs and jewelry made of natural plant parts. Yo bought paper earrings to match her top, and I bought some big fun seed pod earrings, each original handmade purchase under $4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/526274_10150842927968993_677503992_11703262_2134521238_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;412&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We oooh’d and aaaah’d over many different shops, but Jean-Pierre took us into the tequila shops for tastes of their wares. Wow! Some very interesting flavors. And we bought a tequila flavored with membrillo, a beautiful aperitif or dessert liquor. I almost got some chocolate liquor from the second shop that was out of this world but restrained myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was lunch where they introduced us to a very fine arrachera, which is a marinated steak, thin like the Mexicans do it, but cooked to perfection and, oh, so gooooood, and the grilled marinated shrimp were scrumptious! Now, wherever we go we have to try the arrachera! Three places so far, but that was the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/523969_10150842932913993_677503992_11703313_1477186929_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;549&quot; height=&quot;411&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/485655_10150842933258993_677503992_11703319_905966958_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;412&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward to Guadalajara. Jean-Pierre has been down here a while and drives like a Mexican, which is to say he’s fearless! And they know where the interesting things are. Downtown is popular on the weekends and there is a huge market covering a couple of city blocks and three stories tall! Glenn forgot to wear his hat, so we went in search of un sombrero nuevo. I bought one for about $7.25, and we finally found one for Glenn at about $18, and fine hats they are! They guy selling the men’s hats had spent a bit of time in California, so Glenn got to use his cholo impersonation on him -- ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/581238_10150842942193993_677503992_11703371_1155888420_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;557&quot; height=&quot;417&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/560278_10150842942463993_677503992_11703376_420311012_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;412&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wandered around the big city, we saw some clowns entertaining a small crowd and wandered up.  Oops!  We&#39;ve been spotted and dragged into the show!  But Yolanda and I each got a nice little balloon flower and gave multiple almost-kisses to the clown on the cheek and mugged for the crowd. Silly gringas!  And we saw a monk floating over his rug -- woo-woo -- and he had big Jerry Lewis teeth through which to give his sage advice to the onlookers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/295243_10150842951663993_677503992_11703414_1117240413_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;732&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/535231_10150842943653993_677503992_11703383_1681778862_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;552&quot; height=&quot;414&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished up on the way back with a trip to Costco and then headed home. We took a back road to avoid some traffic and got to enjoy sunset in some small villages along the way. A great trip -- and a big thank you to our friends for a fine day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all of the photos from the day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150842926278993.471576.677503992&amp;type=3&amp;l=6c76603fd0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>We Hiked up the Mountain in Ajijic</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/we-hiked-up-the-mountain-in-ajijic/"/>
		<updated>2012-05-01T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/we-hiked-up-the-mountain-in-ajijic/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/318145_10150874198573993_677503992_11798280_942954306_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning was warm and sunny -- no big surprise here in Mexico -- and we went and picked up our friend Rebecca and went up to do our hike up to see the chapel and the views and get some exercise.  The trail was steep and slippery with rocks and scree, which made for some interesting noises and gestures -- and only a couple minor falls.  Rebecca had the foresight to print out a map of the area and the trails, lucky for us.  We still hiked a different trail than we intended, but that was okay.  We weren&#39;t going anywhere in particular, so how could we be lost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the trails are on the same mountainside overlooking Lake Chapala and Ajijic anyway.  Oh.  And none of them are marked except the foot of the mountain where we started.  If we hadn&#39;t met a lady at the first major fork, we might have just hiked ourselves straight across to another &amp;quot;parking area.&amp;quot;  Quotes because it&#39;s just neighborhoods across there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/544696_10150874160073993_677503992_11798196_813627107_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stations of the cross up there were interesting, decorated long ago and now deteriorating.  We came to the chapel.  It was more like a shrine, which is where we thought we were since we didn&#39;t know the Spanish name for chapel, which was on the map -map mistake numero uno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/546072_10150874185228993_677503992_11798253_1136932813_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we headed on up to see if we could find the indigenous ceremonial area, higher up.  Of course, we weren&#39;t anywhere near it, since we weren&#39;t at the shrine but the chapel, so it&#39;s no surprise we never found that.  We just kept going because we didn&#39;t want to think if we&#39;d only gone 20 more yards we would have found it!  But we did find a plowed field -- by horse or mule, no doubt, since no machinery could get up there.  We saw a couple cotton trees (yes, cotton makes trees eventually if not plowed under!), a huge prickly pear tree or two, nice views, and got really nicely sweaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/74785_10150874195078993_677503992_11798276_987421363_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a good hike -- we all made it back in one piece and no blood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the pic album &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150874146793993.474874.677503992&amp;amp;type=1&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Ninety Days In Mexico -- Travelers or Livers?</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/ninety-days-in-mexico-travelers-or-livers/"/>
		<updated>2012-05-14T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/ninety-days-in-mexico-travelers-or-livers/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Random thought of the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not a traveler, I&#39;m a liver!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m42d0tPyZt1qzndqu.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;193&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not that kind of liver! I should probably explain...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most everyone doing what we are doing refers to it as travel. If we have a blog, we&#39;re &#39;travel bloggers.&#39; If someone asks what we do, family and friends tell them we are traveling. But we&#39;ve been taking care of this house here in Chapala, Mexico for three months now. That&#39;s not traveling! We live here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m42dqbkErx1qzndqu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Sure, it&#39;s only temporary. In July we are going to travel across half of Mexico and go visit some people that will be housesitting in Antigua, Guatemala. We&#39;ll be taking the wonderful first-class buses they have here in Mexico. Tons of legroom, reclining seats, your very own video screen with tons of movie selection. We will stop in Guanajuato and San Miguel again, and we&#39;ll probably check out a pyramid and maybe a volcano. After spending a few days in Guatemala we can renew our visas and return to Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we will spend a month taking care of some pets at a yoga retreat near Puerto Escondido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sure, some travel is involved, but then we stop and move in to some home or building and stay for an extended period. Technically most people refer to this as slow travel. Maybe it could also be called fast living! No, wait -- that doesn&#39;t sound right either...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously -- by the time this is all over we will have spent seven or eight or more months in Mexico. That ain&#39;t travelin&#39;, that&#39;s livin&#39;!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My Unsolicited Open Letter to the Class of ________</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/my-unsolicited-open-letter-to-the-class-of/"/>
		<updated>2012-06-02T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/my-unsolicited-open-letter-to-the-class-of/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found out late in life that being a normal worker bee, a cog in the wheel of American society, dragged along by life and what everybody normally does -- school, job, house, cars, possessions, waiting to get old and retire if I didn’t die of some disease or accident first -- maybe wasn’t what I should have done with this one precious life on earth that I was lucky enough to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a brainy child, I was curious and adventurous.  Then I learned:  Children should be seen and not heard; still waters run deep; to do what I’m told; to study and make good grades; to graduate; to go to college; pick a major that I would use the rest of my life; graduate and get a good job; get married....blah, blah, blah.  In other words, don’t be unique or stick out in a crowd; be normal.  I allowed myself to be squelched and to stay that way.  I wasn’t necessarily happy with my life, but life was good enough.  I was normal and had all the nice trappings that privileged Americans have, never rich but certainly not poor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good enough.  GOOD ENOUGH???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindsight is 20/20, right?  I want you to think forward on your path.  What is life going to look like, down to the details, 10, 20, even 30 years from now, if you keep going as you are and life doesn’t throw you a curveball that thwacks you in the head?  Will you have a lot of debt and a nice house and fancy cars that keep you a slave to your job?  Is it a job you really love and you feel really matters?  Do you want to get married?  Kids?  When exactly?  Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why:  That’s the big question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you choose one thing over another?  Is it because you’re supposed to, it’s what’s expected, or because it’s what YOU truly want out of life?  Maybe you should wait and do something else before “settling down” to normal life.  Maybe you don’t really know what you want because you haven’t the experience yet to choose.  You love your current sweetie, so you should get married, right?  Get your career going?  Have some kids?  Maybe.  Or maybe you should travel the country or the world a bit, meeting others, seeing how other people live before tying yourself down to a life that’s “inescapable.”  Do it together, if you’re really in love.  It’s only going to strengthen the relationship or point out that you’re really not that compatible in real life and you can remain friends for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the rush to do the grown-up thing, starting a career, starting a family?  And what’s so great about that anyway?  Maybe there’s other ways to think, other ways to act, other paths besides what your parents did and that all your friends seem to be wanting to do.  Think how different life is now than it was even 10 years ago, how many more opportunities you have to do something great with your life instead of dedicating it to a corporation that doesn’t care about you, nor you for it, all so you can support your debt load for things that really don’t make you happy.  Band-aids on the sores of what could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a so-called normal life, at least stop to think beforehand.  Don’t buy a shiny new car that’s going to be just a car, your ride to work, in several weeks or months.  That payment could go to DOing something really fun and building experiences and living an EXTRAordinary life.  Don’t have accidental kids.  Deliberately plan them.  Once the deed is done, it’s done for good.  No do-overs, at least not without dire consequences.  Think ahead so you don’t have regrets and if-onlies.  Choose life; don’t let circumstances or other people choose for you, because they certainly will.  And they want you to do exactly what they’re doing, because they don’t have the gumption to do anything different.  Don’t be them -- be YOU.  Have a plan and the gumption to stick it out.  Or to deliberately choose to change it.  Plan to be able to change your plan if you want to.  Don’t let normal life trap you, because it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to older people about the path they chose and how that went.  What regrets do they have?  Might you find yourself trapped with the same regrets?  Not if you learn to dream and think and then plan for it.  What issues do you care about?  Will you be able to volunteer time to the cause if you want to?  Or will you be trapped in a job you hate because you really need the money to support your normal life?  If you get downsized out of your job, will you be fine or thrown into panic and depression because life as you know it will be in a shambles at your feet?  Or will you be able to take it as an opportunity to do something you feel matters or to take time off to regroup and recharge and rethink?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think.  Think things through without emotional trappings to sway you.  Ooooh, shiny, pretty will tarnish before you get it paid off.  Memories and lessons are what you take with you into your future, not your stuff.  Too much stuff will trap you because it’s too much trouble or too expensive to move or store, and so you sit, stagnant, wishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planner lives like no one else now so they can live like no one else later.  Think about that one.  Read it again.  Understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read a lot.  Listen.  Observe.  Think.  Then act.  Action is the most important.  And act deliberately or circumstances and other people will choose the path for you and steal your one precious life from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“let them call you crazy&lt;br&gt;
Because what they call crazy…&lt;br&gt;
…is what they’re afraid to do themselves.&lt;br&gt;
And I am certain&lt;br&gt;
That in this one precious life&lt;br&gt;
The crazies…&lt;br&gt;
…not the cowards…&lt;br&gt;
win.”    — Ash Ambirge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://themiddlefingerproject.com/&quot;&gt;themiddlefingerproject.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know, tiki is so South Pacific and we’re in Mexico -- but it’s also retro American kitsch that evokes silliness and warmth and friends having cocktails at sunset. So grab your tiki mug and just go with me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5djr07vUY1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what could be so different about food prep in Mexico? What’s the big deal? Well, for me, it is quite different and a challenge. I can’t really put my finger on one thing or one area and explain it to anyone, so there will be several articles in this series about food purchase, preparation, and cooking -- and some authentic Mexican recipes that I find easy and tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: First off, I’m no cocinera! I can cook basic stuff fairly well at home in the US. But when I came to Mexico, I found so many differences in the food and how it cooks and what’s available, that I had to stop and regroup and ask for help from an expert -- our Mexican housekeeper. (She came with the house-sit job -- score!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re going to explore shopping and cooking here in the state of Jalisco, Mexico.  From what I hear, this vast country has many styles, and each state is different. Hang onto your hats -- it&#39;s not Tex Mex!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the roof above us never fall in, and may the friends gathered below it never fall out.-Unknown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Clothes Shopping in the Big City -- Guadalajara, Jalisco, MX</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/clothes-shopping-in-the-big-city-guadalajara/"/>
		<updated>2012-06-16T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/clothes-shopping-in-the-big-city-guadalajara/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was a big treat -- my neighborhood friend Yolanda took me shopping all around the city center area near the big cathedral in downtown Guadalajara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many stores for everything you can imagine.  There&#39;s even a building the size of Sears or Penney&#39;s, multiple floors, that is full, full, full of nothing but jewelry shops.  Lots of police all around that one -- with big dogs, beautiful Belgian Malinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/market.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some expensive fru-fru stores, but we didn&#39;t go to those.  I&#39;m on a budget, and I need things for the heat and the beach.  My heavy dark pants and tops aren&#39;t going to cut it anymore.  Usually I shop and shop and buy nothing, but today was a good day, starting with a nice little comfy artsy top for 130 pesos ($9.40).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/blouse2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we went to another store where I bought a fluffy dressy blouse for 180 pesos ($13.02) and an open-knit ziz-zag top for 130 pesos ($9.40).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/skirt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/blouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went in three shoe shops before they had my choice of sandals for my big size 8 feet.  Those set me back 160 pesos ($11.57).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/shoes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a nice jersey sundress for 120 pesos ($8.68) and some decorated jeans for 150 pesos ($10.85).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/pinkdress.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/jeans.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wandered through the huge multi-story market with stalls and stalls of everything from cow feet and ankles to veggies to little birds to clothing and purses and toys and pink guitars in green cases to mariachi suits adult to baby size.  I really don&#39;t know how you would cook a cow hoof with about 10 inches of leg, but apparently somebody does.  And I have a local friend who loves to eat chicken feet that are sold everywhere you buy chicken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a nice leather belt for Glenn for 180 pesos ($13.02) and Yo bought some little purses to give as gifts on her trip back to Canada in a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also bought a cotton skirt that I didn&#39;t really want that bad, but she kept coming down on the price.  It wasn&#39;t the price I objected to but finally I felt I had to buy it.  It will be great in the beach heat though.  Not $250 pesos ($18.08) but 190 pesos ($13.74).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/imagesgreenskirt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went into the big cathedral and sat for a few minutes looking at the beautiful carving work on the arches and the stained glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch at Yo&#39;s favorite restaurant downtown, El Mexicano, and arrachera that was really good, though not as good as the one we had in Tlaquepaque.  It&#39;s thin flank steak, marinated and cooked to tender perfection.  So good!  We have it wherever we go and judge each restaurant on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So amazingly I bought eight major clothing items and spent a whopping $89.69 US.  Do that in Dallas!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>MY TIKI BAR KITCHEN -- 2</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/my-tiki-bar-kitchen-2/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;LET’S START WITH SHOPPING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started living here and quickly discovered that if you want fresh veggies, you should go to the tianguis.  Most towns have their own market day, and Chapala’s is Monday; neighbor town Ajijic’s is Wednesday.  The tianguis are markets set up along the street, sheltered with tarps, and they sell everything imaginable that you can carry away in a bag, from food to clothing and CDs and DVDs and toys.  &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dn3x8sfj1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dpfhr29A1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;Some of the veggies are a third the price of the grocery store, and most all are significantly cheaper.  And the grocery gets their produce trucked in from who-knows-where, while the tianguis usually get theirs from the nearby Guadalajara farmers market as well as their own gardens or farms.  Not as convenient as one-stop shopping in a store, but it’s always fun and interesting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dmkn9yZy1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dphjqu3z1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many different veggies and fruits available, many of which I’ve never encountered.  My what-the-hell-is-that moments are getting fewer and farther between, but they still happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dmqtYJfF1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dp5td6ly1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now buying our veggies for the week here, and we will either buy a couple of fresh fish (whole and cleaned or filleted) or some chicken breasts, all very fresh and tasty.  We buy our hamburger (real cubes of fresh beef ground while we watch) and bacon sliced to our specs at a little butcher shop or carniceria across the street from the Soriana grocery store.  If we need fresh cheeses, we can get that at the tianguis too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesdays there is an organic market where I buy my assorted lettuces and salad leaves, like baby spinach, sorrel, and Swiss chard, since many are already washed and disinfected or at least the dirt mostly rinsed out.  More expensive, but organic -- and it saves me a lot of work.  This market has organic breads and prepared foods, honey, eggs, clothing, juices, all kinds of produce, organic soaps, toothpaste, shampoo and more -- and it&#39;s in an actual building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dncjgkSO1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dpc4hKiE1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then there’s Super Lake grocery where you can get all kinds of gringo food so you can eat like you’re still in the States -- for a price.  For example, I bought a small roll of frozen Jimmy Dean sausage for some stuffed jalepenos I want to make, and that cost me $8.50 US!  I had already bought the other ingredients at Soriana or I would have opted out.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local Walmart has a lot of gringo stuff -- especially in the “ethnic section” -- and looks more familiar.  A lot of expats shop at Walmart and Super Lake, but they’re missing out on the experience of living in Mexico, if you ask me.  They’re often afraid to venture out to the markets.  We have shopped in them since we got here in mid-February and have never had or seen a problem or anything to be afraid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found the people here very nice and welcoming and helpful, even though our Spanish is pretty pitiful.  Yes, there is crime, yes, there is violence, but you don’t go where that is, for the most part.  Sometimes you can’t avoid it, but it’s the same back home too.  Really, it’s family people going about their business of living here, not a bunch of thugs and pickpockets waiting to prey on the gringos.  You might end up paying a little more than local Mexicans in the markets unless you’re willing to step out of your comfort zone and bargain, but it’s to be expected.  Even just hesitating and starting to leave will often get you a much better price automatically.  The prices are better than you’d ever get in the States, so many gringos just pay them the quoted amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when in Rome -- or wherever you are -- do as the locals do.  You’ll be richer for it, both experientially and financially!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to our first recipe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOLY GUACAMOLE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always loved guacamole, but I never had the gumption to try to make my own.  It’s so easy -- who knew!  Great with chips or Lorena made it as a side dish when she prepared fish for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two to four servings, depending on your serving size, you need:&lt;br&gt;
2 man-fist-sized avocados that are a little soft, nicely ripe&lt;br&gt;
1 large or two small Roma tomatoes, finely diced&lt;br&gt;
½ medium onion, finely diced&lt;br&gt;
1 large limon (key lime) or half a regular lime&lt;br&gt;
fresh cilantro, finely chopped&lt;br&gt;
salt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m63ec9Z77U1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing avocados was daunting to me until I&#39;d bought a lot of them and have had them ripening in the kitchen.  I now know that it&#39;s great when it&#39;s just a little soft all over.  If there are areas that you can actually press in on, that part might be black inside -- yuk.  Then you have to just scoop around that part.  Avocados don&#39;t really ripen on the tree, apparently, so often they are rock hard at the store.  Just take them home and put them in a bowl on the counter and check on them till they&#39;re ripe.  Or I&#39;ve heard putting them in a paper bag might be better.  I haven&#39;t tried that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;Take a big knife and slice the avocado, seed deep, all the way around longways.  Twist the two halves and they will come apart with the seed staying in one side.  Whack your knife blade into the seed, give it a little twist, and it will come out cleanly -- keep the seed handy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scoop out the tasty meat from both avocados into a bowl, and mash it with a fork.  Squeeze the limon (lime) juice onto the mash to prevent any browning of the fruit if you get delayed.  Use quite a bit of juice for great flavor.  Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well.  Play with the amount of cilantro, limon juice, and salt to get the flavor you want.  Serve with chips -- and margaritas!  It’s also wonderful as just a side salad-y dish with many of your favorite meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.8239042330533266&quot;&gt;Garnish with some tomato pieces, onion bits, and cilantro and/or chips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIPS:  If your guacamole is going to be served a little later, put the seed back into the middle of it.  Somehow it helps to keep it fresh.  Cover with plastic wrap, placed directly on the guacamole so that the contact with air is minimized and refrigerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you will find the tostadas, possibly in the Mexican food aisle, these make very fine-tasting chips if you break them up.  Probably significantly cheaper than a bag of chips too, though not as perfectly pretty. &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5errr7e5b1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>MY TIKI BAR KITCHEN -- 3</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/my-tiki-bar-kitchen-3/"/>
		<updated>2012-06-23T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/my-tiki-bar-kitchen-3/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;THE FOOD IS DIFFERENT HERE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is shopping a bit different -- unless you do the gringo thing and buy all your stuff at Super Lake or Walmart -- but the food itself is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ll never sell a fat yellow chicken.”  Ad words from one of the big chicken mega processors in the US.  When I got here and saw all the yellow chicken for sale in the stores and the markets, I was appalled -- I’m talking rubber-chicken-paint yellow.  I didn’t know what to make of it.  Yuck!  I refused to buy any chicken for the first few weeks until I found out that the yellow is on purpose and caused by marigold-type flowers in their diet.  Okay, much better -- whew!  The chicken here is actually very tasty and good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m64tcdq66k1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention the feet are included in a whole roasting/boiling chicken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veggies are fresh and local, and many appear alien -- like “from Mars” alien.  Also you can get fresh organic veggies and lettuces at the organic market that are a lot less work once you get them home.  The lettuce at the tianguis is fresh out of the ground complete with whatever little bugs and dirt that are in it.  If I buy that, I have to cut it apart into separate leaves, wash them well, and disinfect them in the solution for 10 minutes in the sink.  Then the leaves must be drained and then dried and put into baggies before being put into the fridge.  A bit of work.  Or you can clean and disinfect some each time you want salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m65jn52sHZ1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;280&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m65js5fpMS1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;280&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the organic market, you can get lettuces and other salad leaves are already washed and dried and ready to use.  It’s well worth the bit of extra cost over the tianguis.  Or for a bit less you can buy the fresh-picked heads of all kinds of lettuces and wash and disinfect it.  Calabaza squash, tomatoes, onions, avocados, and other veggies, you have to soak them in the disinfectant anyway, but that’s easy, so I just buy the tianguis offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I’m not sure why Americans don’t disinfect things like spinach and lettuce now, since there have been so many E. coli outbreaks in recent years.  Water alone doesn’t kill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburger, either at the carniceria or the grocery store, has very little fat.  I used to make bigger, thicker patties because I knew they would cook down quite a bit.  Here, they stay about the same size, and there’s very little fat to drain.  So our first hamburger patties were HUGE.  This is how much fat wasn&#39;t in the pan when they were done! &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m65m4rBdZ01qzu24w.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular meat cuts in the States aren’t really sold down here.  Unless you go to a gringo boutique carniceria, you won’t find a roast or a brisket.  They have some steaks and hamburger and bistek.  Bistek is very thin, like about ¼ inch or a little more.  I tried cooking it fast in a cast iron skillet, but that’s just not good.  We don’t buy the regular steaks since we don’t have a grill here, and I don’t like pan steak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy fresh organic eggs at the organic market, but they are really small and pretty expensive, so -- against my better judgment -- I buy the extra omega 3 eggs at Soriana grocery store.  We go through almost 2 ½ dozen eggs a week, and we’re on a budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eggs from the mega henhouse are very large here, bigger than extra-large back in Texas, and the yolks are very large compared to US eggs.  The yolks are also usually a very bright pretty orange.  I believe the orange is from the yellow flowers that the chickens are all fed here.  And eggs are not refrigerated.  In fact, many countries around the world keep their eggs non-refrigerated and always have.  People aren’t dropping dead from salmonella either.  Eggs have no need for refrigeration -- unless they have been refrigerated -- althoughit’s probably not a good idea to keep them out in the summer heat very long.  In a store or home is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m65kikn1So1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing about eggs, possibly because they’re not refrigerated, is that there’s a trick to not breaking the yolks if you want to fry them sunny.  You have to be very careful not to rake them with the shell as you drop them into the skillet.  I am getting better at it, but success isn’t a given.  Thankfully, Glenn likes his broken and/or with hard yolks anyhow, since I usually only get 3 of 4 whole. And then there&#39;s boiled eggs -- the yolks all go to one end and poke out of the whites. I wonder if it&#39;s because the whites are thinner without refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m65kn0DnfJ1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s BACON!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacon, the meat everyone loves to hate -- unless you’re on a low-carb diet &lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/simple-smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;  At the carniceria that we go to they slice it up on the spot, whatever thickness desired.  We’ve also bought the FUD brand bacon at the grocery store.  (Really?  If you have to name it “food,” is it?  It’s actually pretty good bacon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the packaged and fresh bacon take &lt;em&gt;for-evver&lt;/em&gt; to cook.  I have no idea why.&lt;br&gt;
And there’s hardly any fat left behind in the pan.  If you like to save and use bacon drippings, here you’re going to have to cook a LOT of bacon.  The flavor is milder too -- not as addicting.  (Hmmmm, what do they use to enhance the flavor in the States?  Flavor addiction in all processed food is bi-i-i-ig business.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m65kqwKfZt1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;  
This is an entire package of bacon chopped and cooked, and no fat has been removed!
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of bacon --&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carne en su jugo (meat in its juice)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful Mexican stew, of sorts.  The first time I saw a sign for this dish, I thought it said “meat in your juice” and pictured a frosty glass of orange with a hunk of meat in it -- YISH!  Ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Super Lake grocery, they had some free samples of a jarred brand and so I tried it.  It was delicious.  I almost bought a jar, but our housekeeper, Lorena, had said she was going to teach me that one the following week.  I hired her to teach me a recipe a week while we’re here.  Smartest move ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...on to the recipe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CARNE EN SU JUGO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 small tomatillos (green tomato-like veggies with a papery outer shell and sticky skin, remove the papery shells and wash)&lt;br&gt;
½ lb bacon&lt;br&gt;
2 lb “bistek” -- ¼” thick skirt steak  (** see note below!)&lt;br&gt;
2-3 medium-large cloves of garlic&lt;br&gt;
½ -- 1 serrano chili pepper&lt;br&gt;
1 onion fairly finely diced&lt;br&gt;
cilantro finely chopped&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a can of beans, white or your favorite, if you choose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;limones (key limes -- or regular limes) for squeezing onto your serving to taste&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m65memony01qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the tomatillos in a pan of water and boil the heck out of them for about 10-15 minutes, till they are very-ripe-soft, drain and let cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chop the bacon into ¾” pieces and cook it in a good-sized pot till done but not crisp at all.  Mexican bacon, it’s best to add some oil to the pan to cook it.  (American bacon, you’ll probably want to drain out most of the fat after you get it cooked and you might need closer to a whole pound.  Can’t have too much bacon, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bacon cooks, chop the bistek into bite-sized pieces.  When the bacon is ready, add the chopped meat or hamburger and cook it till done.  Salt the meat, maybe a half teaspoon plus/minus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the meat is cooking, put the cooled tomatillos into a blender, add several pieces/stalks/branches (whatever you’d call them) of fresh cilantro, the 2 cloves of garlic, ½-1 serrano pepper to taste, about 1 ½ cups of water.  Blend very well and long so that everything is chopped up fine  (depending on your blender, you may want to chop the garlic and the serrano pepper before adding them)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the meat is cooked, pour the blender contents into the pot.  Cover and simmer/boil for 20 minutes or so.  Check the flavor and adjust if needed.  You may need to boil off some water or add more, depending on your preferences.  It should be fairly soupy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s cooking, chop finely the onion and more cilantro.  These will be added raw to each serving to taste, and as a pretty garnish.  You can add a few little pieces of red tomato to make it pretty, and it adds to the flavor too.  Limones are squeezed on to taste (I like it as is, without the limon, personally)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve in a bowl with a spoon and tortillas for sopping.  Or if you make it thicker, you can spoon it into your tortillas as a wet taco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIP:  Flour tortillas from the store are so much tastier if you “toast” them on both sides in a dry pan on the stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** This dish is also good with hamburger in place of the bistek, and it doesn’t have to cook as long.  Just let the flavors meld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salud! -- to your health!&lt;strong id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.4579134329687804&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ahhh, to wake up in a new place with new sounds and new air -- refreshing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got up a little before dawn here in the beautiful mountain town of Guanajuato in Mexico this morning.  The area around our hostel, Hostel Alonzo, in the heart of the Zona Central is starting to bustle already.  As the flock of pigeons started to stir and walk around their innumerable little cubbies and niches in the wall across the street, the roosters started crowing in the day from houses all around us, and all the wild birdies started to sing in the morning, I sipped my hot coffee on the rooftop terrace that Glenn hiked down and bought for us earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will this day hold in store for us?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Death and Beyond in Guanajuato, Mexico</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/death-and-beyond-in-guanajuato-mexico/"/>
		<updated>2012-07-04T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/death-and-beyond-in-guanajuato-mexico/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So Wednesday morning, July 4, we awoke early and went to breakfast at Casa Ofelia. We appeared to be the first customers of the day. Soon after we sat down, a very small indigenous man in white traditional garb with a guitar on his back came in to pray and bless himself at the little altar of Mary just inside the front door. Then he began to play and sing &lt;em&gt;Besa Me Mucho&lt;/em&gt; at us. We were also his first customers of the day. Remembering what my Mexicana friend Tere had told me about the importance of the first customer and its influence on the way the day goes, we gave him a few pesos. The next customers rebuffed him and he left after kissing a few more pictures on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015019451_34e21ceab9_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our breakfast was quite tasty, and then we were on our way -- to see a museum full of mummified corpses under glass, at least one of which is believed to have been accidentally buried alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guanajuato is famous for its Museo de las Momias where over 100 naturally mummified bodies are on display, many of which were buried during a cholera outbreak in 1833. They were disinterred between 1865 and 1958 when families failed to pay the yearly tax to keep them in the mausoleum (later the law changed and they quit pulling them out). At some point workers started charging a few pesos to see them, and the famous museum was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015107807_61270cbedd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dry climate and conditions in the mausoleum dried and preserved many bodies before they could decay.  The skin even shows the pores and texture, and much of the hair is there -- some in disturbing places.  Many are still clothed, at least partially.  So many have no clothing, and I wonder if they were just buried naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignacia Aguilar-Chirilo suffered from catalepsy, which made her heart appear to stop for long periods. During one of these incidents in 1922, her heart appeared to stop for more than the usual time so she was declared dead and her relatives decided to bury her. When her body was disinterred, her arms were over her head instead of simply being crossed over the body. It appears she was biting her arm, and there were wounds on her forehead. Not how you want to wake up and spend your last minutes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015031818_51f701f55d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This museum also houses the smallest mummy in the world, along with its unfortunate mother. She was a victim of malnutrition and cholera and died when she was 6 months pregnant.  Her child is one of the most well-preserved mummies, according to the notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015031978_5675059235.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the babies were lovingly dressed and accessorized for burial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015107862_50ebbc8822.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015107257_7e387e5b7b_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015019626_f6a2145ebe_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broom is for one of the saints, I believe.  The one wearing rubber pants looks like it was a much later burial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough with all the death.  Before we went to the mummy museum, we got waylaid by a tour hawker with a nice private walking tour in English. Our guide, Manuel, has lived all his life in Guanajuato, and is a very young and energetic 71.  He even told us about how he and a couple of his altar boy friends found a secret passage under one of the cathedrals that contained torture devices from the Inquisition and some old paintings that were probably ordered destroyed but were hidden instead.  One is of a pregnant Virgin Mary and now hangs in the foyer of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015107367_dc072edba9_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manuel said that the priest caught the already spooked boys when they came up from the passage. He told them they must never, ever speak of it or they would go to hell.  He never did, at least until that priest died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of Guanajuato for me, both this trip and back in 2008, are the nightly singing tours to the Alley of the Kiss. Students at the University of Guanajuato (estudiantinas) dress like troubadours and sing and play instruments and clown around and give a very entertaining tour.  Since the old part of the city is shaped like a bowl you can hear their wonderful male voices everywhere. The tours start outside the 2nd most beautiful theater in all of Mexico, Teatro Juarez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48015107487_d459a7f1fc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much to see and take pictures of, but I think this post is already long enough. To see more, check out the slideshow below, or click on any image to pop on over to the album on Flickr and see the best photos and their descriptions!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>San Miguel de Allende</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/san-miguel-de-allende/"/>
		<updated>2012-07-06T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/san-miguel-de-allende/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We arrived safely here after a rather hair-raising bus ride in a very luxurious coach.  Our driver was apparently in rather a hurry to get here on the winding country highway. Glenn was bothered by this a lot more than Bryn was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ro7cTg9T1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6rojdhFEt1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6rom6OO8X1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed an area where farmers were walking behind their old-school plows pulled by horses or mules, but by the time I realized I should take a picture, we were in ranching country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A taxi brought us to our chosen hostel, but the prices weren&#39;t what we expected, so we found another nearby hotel that was half the price.  Turns out it was just down the block from the main jardin and Starbucks, so it&#39;s all good.  Hotel Posada has a nice courtyard and large rooms and a view of the top of the landmark Parrocchia from our third-floor balcony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6rp8dq8ZG1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6rpaxH9Sn1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a couple of long walks around the city, including all the way to the little place we stayed in 2008.  We checked out a couple of cathedrals.  It seems that if you aren&#39;t into shopping, there&#39;s not a lot to do here, so we spent a lot of time in Starbucks on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6rpmwAK611qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6rpx8mxO11qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;180&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still a pretty town, still not as enjoyable as Guanajuato for us. For one thing, it seemed as if gringos were everywhere. Back in 2008 we noted that we rarely saw any at all. I&#39;m not sure what changed. Either the gringos are only out and about on certain days, or at certain times of the year, or we were just so overwhelmed by it all back then that we simply missed them. Another difference is the makeup of the two towns. The old part of San Miguel is all designed around shopping and eating for gringo expats and rich Mexicans. The old part of Guanajuato has less trendy shops and more local small-town businesses and lots of students everywhere, and very few gringos. Evidently we like being tourists in areas that don&#39;t really cater to tourists so much. Strange, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don&#39;t let us stop you from visiting! Just keep it in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>On The Road Again</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/on-the-road-again/"/>
		<updated>2012-07-07T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/on-the-road-again/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Bus Terminal&quot; src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/600165_10151896098365437_1236436281_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, at long last, the next phase of our journey begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks have been busy. Our homeowner dropped in for a two-week stay and initiated a flurry of activity! We ran around getting automobile repair estimates and looking for replacement kitchen sinks and cleaning the house in preparation for the new property managers to take pictures. We also showed the home to a potential renter and took both dogs and both cats to the vet. In addition to that, we picked up some utensils and cookware and a portable electric stove top. We also got the house ready for the new housesitter and went over all of the details with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/376442_10151896099480437_403310213_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Tuesday morning we had a driver pick us up and deliver us to the main bus station in eastern Guadalajara, near Tonala. We rode in amazing comfort on a Primera Plus coach and stopped only once. The whole trip lasted just over four hours. The seats lean back twice as far as on the standard economy fare airline seat, and they have footrests that fold down from the seat in front. Lights and air vents are overhead. Each seat has its own audio jack where you can listen to one of several stations or just pick up the audio from the on-board movie. I watched Transformers 2 in Spanish. Interesting. There are also men&#39;s and women&#39;s restrooms in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/600382_10151896100380437_1848917125_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stopped at Leon it began to rain, but by the time we were halfway to Guanajuato the skies had cleared. At one point our bus was selected (randomly?) for an inspection by some nice people from the Mexican army. The first one on board announced the inspection and seemed to generally calm everyone. He then walked through and inspected everyone&#39;s bags and purses. I presume he was looking for weapons, drugs and/or explosives. And just in case you thought his calm demeanor was a sign of weakness, a second soldier stepped into the doorway and watched while resting his hand on the grip of his H&amp;amp;K G3 Battle Rifle. That&#39;s a big gun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/306606_10151897024320437_59276117_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very soon we were on our way again and we arrived in Guanajuato only slightly behind schedule. We took a taxi directly to our intended destination, the Hostel Alonso. We were so excited -- our very first night in a hostel! And so far it has not disappointed one bit. Our room is private and on the second floor. The shower is also the toilet. The toilets do not have seats. Supposedly this has something to do with scorpions, but I think I&#39;d rather not know for sure... The bed is just about as firm as it can get. We are, so far, sharing the facilities with two Japanese girls and two other couple from parts unknown. We are, also, unsurprisingly the oldest people in the building, by far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/314072_10151896101395437_1880566886_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/396623_10151896102090437_627351429_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/376323_10151897024460437_1622543814_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strolled the city a couple of times, mainly the area around the Jardin de la Union. We walked by Casa de Pita, the B&amp;amp;B we used on our first visit back in 2008. We bought a coca light and an agua at the nearby tienda just for old times sake. We had a decent dinner at a restaurant, a latte at a local coffee shop and picked up some drinks and snacks at an Oxxo convenience store. All set for the night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/530797_10151896104440437_57620121_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/250820_10151896102585437_88422294_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the rainy season in this part of Mexico. It starts in mid-June and ends later in the year. Normally they say that the rain arrives with San Antonio and departs with San Francisco. No, not the cities — those are days honoring the saints. Dia de San Antonio is June 13, Dia de San Francisco is October 10. The rain started in Chapala right around June 11, and it hasn&#39;t stopped since. Mostly it rains in the middle of the night, but here and there you get it during the day as well. It rained last night so hopefully we can walk around all day without worrying about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More pictures soon, and most will be added to Facebook. You can see the whole album here:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My Tiki Bar Kitchen -- 4</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/my-tiki-bar-kitchen-4/"/>
		<updated>2012-07-22T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/my-tiki-bar-kitchen-4/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today let&#39;s do a couple of different but out-of-the-ordinary recipes, both easy and delicious! That was one of my requirements for Lorena, simple. She came through on most occasions since I managed to communicate that I&#39;m no cook. So put on your apron, pop a cork (always cook with wine!), and jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATUN! (ah-toon)  OR A NEW TAKE ON TUNA SALAD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun is the Spanish word for tuna.  I’m not a big canned tuna fan, so I wasn’t excited about it -- until I tasted it.  The way the Mexicans do it is to my liking!  I’ll list the full recipe, but you can do it without some things and jimmy it around and it’s still really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7kkfhIuhs1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;170&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7kkkfNrIb1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;170&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7kkopNdXB1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;170&quot;&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with two regular cans of tuna, drained&lt;br&gt;
2 Roma tomatoes diced “chiquita” (small)&lt;br&gt;
1 small onion diced small&lt;br&gt;
1 can of “tuna salad” that already has some peas, carrots, mayo in it&lt;br&gt;
1 cup of “crema” -- it’s like full whipping cream only a bit thicker&lt;br&gt;
(it comes from the cheese tianguis in a plastic cup with a wax paper cover)&lt;br&gt;
2 big spoons of your favorite mayo&lt;br&gt;
1/2-1 small can of whole yellow corn, drained (1-serving size)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix it all up together and serve it on “saladitas,” which are saltines, or on tostadas or with chips.  It makes a great light lunch or an accompaniment to a big green salad or with soup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time she made this, she didn’t have the can of tuna salad or the crema, and it was still delicious.&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7kkty5a6D1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for something kinda scary for gringos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camarones are shrimp — good, fresh shrimp -- yum!&lt;br&gt;
For some reason when she said she was going to do ceviche, I was thinking of cold veggie soup, like Italian gazpacho!  Don’t ask me why.  Definitely not what I was expecting, but this is SO good.  Don’t be afraid -- just go with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7kjvuhVYS1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEVICHE DE CAMARONES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 lbs of fresh shrimp, cleaned, shelled and tails off, cut in 3-4 bite-sized pieces&lt;br&gt;
several large limes, maybe 6-8&lt;br&gt;
salt&lt;br&gt;
¼ cup each of finely chopped tomato, peeled cucumber, red onion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;½ -- 1 serrano pepper, seeds removed, finely chopped&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;several cilantro stalks &amp;amp; leaves finely chopped&lt;br&gt;
1 ripe avocado -- or two&lt;br&gt;
tostadas -- flat, round, hard tortilla shells that come like that from the store&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean and cut up the shrimp to bite-size pieces, sprinkle it with salt, put it in a bowl that’s deeper than wide so you can cover the shrimp with fresh-squeezed lime juice.  Cover it and let it sit for 1 ½ hours.  You will notice that it looks cooked -- and it sort of is cooked.  Yes, it’s safe if the shrimp were fresh!  Hey, I had it in Mexico and I’m still here and didn’t have the slightest bit of negative intestinal reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get ready to eat, chop the tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, cilantro, and&lt;br&gt;
hot pepper (to taste).  Put all that in a bowl and add the drained shrimp pieces and mix well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve piled on tostadas and top with thinly sliced avocado.  So gooood!&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7kk4exTUW1qzu24w.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buen provecho and salud!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Photo Contest: Capture the Colour</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/photo-contest-capture-the-colour/"/>
		<updated>2012-07-31T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/photo-contest-capture-the-colour/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a new photo contest going on and I was &#39;tagged&#39; by my friend Wes (aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnyvagabond.com/&quot;&gt;Johnny Vagabond&lt;/a&gt;). Sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelsupermarket.com/&quot;&gt;TravelSupermarket.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are some great prizes (iPads!) and the contest is being judged by some amazing photographers/bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are pretty simple: post photos on your blog that fit the following themes: Red, Blue, White, Green and Yellow. Share your post via social media (see the rules below for details) and nominate five other bloggers to join in the fun. If you don’t have all five, post what you have. Easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kenkaminesky.com/&quot;&gt;Ken Kaminesky&lt;/a&gt; is judging the &lt;strong&gt;Blue&lt;/strong&gt; category. Daniel of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canvas-of-light.com/&quot;&gt;Canvas of Light&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of &lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt;, while Abi of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidethetravellab.com/&quot;&gt;Inside the Travel Lab&lt;/a&gt; will be looking over the &lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt; entries. Dave and Deb of &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplanetd.com/&quot;&gt;The Planet D&lt;/a&gt; are in charge of &lt;strong&gt;Yellow&lt;/strong&gt; and Christine over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://almostfearless.com/&quot;&gt;Almost Fearless&lt;/a&gt; will judge &lt;strong&gt;White&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest ends August 27th, and the winner of each color category will receive a new iPad. The overall winner will net a £2,000 travel budget from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelsupermarket.com/&quot;&gt;TravelSupermarket.com&lt;/a&gt;. You don’t have to be nominated to participate, so dig through those photos and get to blogging!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is from Humboldt Redwoods State Park in northern California. In the background you can see the roots of one of many fallen Coastal Redwoods. It was never a record-holder, but it probably lived several hundred years before it fell. Most people probably don&#39;t take this shot, but something about the surrounding greenery and lighting caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Mexico City Revisited</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/mexico-city-revisited/"/>
		<updated>2012-08-06T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/mexico-city-revisited/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We visited Mexico City in 2008 and it&#39;s an exciting city with lots to see and do, so we had to revisit while we were on our way, eventually, to Guatemala.  Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tripadvisor.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trip Advisor&lt;/a&gt; we found a great hotel in a great location for little money.  From the outside it looks like a flophouse between a newspaper company and an Oxxo convenience store, but it&#39;s actually a nice retro hotel on the inside, complete with an old crank-handle-and-cage elevator with a security guard running it 24 hours a day.  Our room had a nice view of the city and a kitchenette for around $40 a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698667644&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Our room&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7134/7698667644_706c704ebe_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our room&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican elections had just happened with a major reversal of the party in power, so there were protests going on, and here is one street where the posters were all gathered (below).  Apparently a lot of people are upset and accusing the winning party of cheating with false votes and bought votes.  The posters say democracy is dead, among other things. The next day we walked to the Zocalo, the main square, and it&#39;s huge.  They have some interesting little vehicles you can rent to tour around in. And the cathedral there is huge!  Nothing special was going on when we were there, but in 2008 they had a huge festival of some kind with all the indian tribes doing dances and shamans doing mysterious things.  Quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we were on the way to see Templo Mayor and its museum.  This was the main temple of the Aztecs in their capital city way back when.  You can learn about it on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templo_Mayor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698749800&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Serpent head and frog entrance&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8291/7698749800_28f3c3199d_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Serpent head and frog entrance&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698755010&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Face knives used in human sacrifice&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 0px initial initial;&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8146/7698755010_25960f6ae7_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Face knives used in human sacrifice&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698765752&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Beautiful ancient pottery&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7269/7698765752_559fc15ae4_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beautiful ancient pottery&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a shot of a serpent head and some frogs for the rain god.  Face knives were used in human sacrifice -- cute and grizzly at the same time.  And they had some gorgeous pottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we took a taxi to the main bus station to get to the pyramids of Teotihuacan, the largest pre-Columbian city in the Americas, an enormous complex.  Of course, we had to climb both the Sun and Moon pyramids, in hopes we lived through it.  They weren&#39;t too bad, considering how they look -- thanks to Rubi, the dog at our last house sit, and her long, twice daily walks through the hills of Chapala Haciendas at 5000 feet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698799018&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Bryn climbing Sun Pyramid&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8025/7698799018_7001851752_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bryn climbing Sun Pyramid&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698817862&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Glenn descending Sun Pyramid&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7262/7698817862_0d547b8281_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Glenn descending Sun Pyramid&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698823658&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Bryn points to the Moon Pyramid from top of Sun Pyramid&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/7698823658_903c6de2c3_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bryn points to the Moon Pyramid from top of Sun Pyramid&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698811110&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Sun Pyramid is steep&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7698811110_1b59b49689_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sun Pyramid is steep&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698792964&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;People have a ceremony&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8006/7698792964_f000baf3d8_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;People have a ceremony&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was even a family there performing some sort of ritual on the plaza near the base of the Sun Pyramid that involved burning something in a bowl, holding the bowl overhead and making prayers in different directions.  They were there for quite some time in their special clothing.  See the little ants way down in the plaza?  No, further down.  Yep, those are people!  After our walk around, we went to the museum there, which is quite interesting.  Again, more info on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last day we walked around a bit and revisited the top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_Latinoamericana&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Torre Latinoamericana, the Latino-American Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and took a few shots.  We hoped we could see the volcano that was acting up, but it was hidden behind closer mountains and there were quite a few clouds that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698724754&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;The Vagabondians taking in the view&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8159/7698724754_77487be3ac_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Vagabondians taking in the view&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698729292&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Large city park&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8027/7698729292_b8398b0094_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Large city park&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7698742480&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Palacio de Bellas Artes&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8288/7698742480_211080d881_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Palacio de Bellas Artes&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a view from up there!  The big city park is being cleaned up and renovated, so we didn&#39;t get to go in.  The Bella de Artes is just as impressive from above as it is from below and inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get the chance, visit Mexico City.  It&#39;s a fascinating and diverse city with too many things to do and see.  Don&#39;t let the US government scare you off.  It&#39;s no more dangerous than Detroit or downtown Dallas, the people are generally more friendly and helpful if you ask, and taxis won&#39;t break the budget.  Just stay where the people are, like you would at home, instead of wandering the back alleys -- duh!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Cars of Mexico -- Good Enough -- Part 1</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/the-cars-of-mexico-good-enough-1/"/>
		<updated>2012-08-10T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/the-cars-of-mexico-good-enough-1/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Initially I was just going to write something about cars, but I have also been contemplating a broader theme regarding Mexico, that of &#39;good enough;&#39; so I guess I will go ahead and make this post the first part of that broader theme. And now for the car part...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha! I&#39;m so hilarious! (get it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place to start is with one&#39;s American expectations. Now that I have been living in Mexico for six months, it is difficult to remember what my expectations were to begin with. Perhaps the best way to approach it is to simply talk about the things about Mexican cars that surprised me. Maybe one could deduce my expectations (whatever those were) from that? We&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first car most people see when they arrive in Mexico is the ubiquitous taxi. At this point in time, the vast majority of those vehicles are Nissan&#39;s, basically a Sentra but badged here as the Tsuru. It was introduced to and assembled in Mexico starting in 1984, but did not displace the VW Beetle as the best-selling car until 1998. As of last year it was still the top-selling car model in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second place is currently the VW Jetta, fourth place is the Chevy Aveo, basically a Daewoo made in Japan. After that, the top sellers are a real variety of models and makes, mostly smaller and mostly a mix of Mexican and Japanese assemblies: Mazda, Toyota, Renault, BMW, etc. The Ford F-150 pickup is sixteenth, which is a marked difference from sales just across the border in Texas. Texans love their trucks, even if they work in an office job. Mexico is much more practical. For work, used vehicles are good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Lake Chapala area, the majority of vehicles are older. The one big exception to this is the cars of the gringo expats from Canada and the United States. For some reason they all want to bring their big, comfy gas-hog cars down to Mexico with them. But most of the roads in Ajijic and Chapala are narrow and paved with rough cobblestone. This wreaks havoc on the suspension of vehicles purchased where the roads are all smooth. While we lived just north of Chapala we had the use of a late-90&#39;s Volvo, but it was a bit beat-up. I often thought that the ideal vehicle down there would have been something with decent clearance underneath, mud tires and beefed-up suspension, an intact but dinged-up body, and pristine interior and engine — the best of both worlds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation was similar in Guanajuato and San Miguel, although Guanajuato&#39;s streets were redone about ten years ago with nice, new flat pavestone. The streets did not, however, get any wider. But Guadalajara and Mexico City were totally different! They have millions of people and the wealthier residents love their luxury cars as much as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to Acapulco I noticed something different though — one particular model of car that began to stand out. There were so many, I couldn&#39;t help but notice. As a matter of fact, one taxi company used this vehicle exclusively, and their blue and white paint scheme was hard to miss. This vehicle was...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volkswagen Beetle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those things were everywhere. I thought at first that this was where old VW bugs came to die, but I was wrong. As I mentioned earlier, for many years they were the best-selling car in all of Mexico. In the United States they were merely a passing fad, popular mainly with hippies. Not so in Mexico. And unlike America, Mexicans are under no illusion that one must trade in their new car every 4-5 years. Why would they? After all, a working car that is already in your possessions is &lt;em&gt;good enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we worked our way down the Pacific coast and then up into the highlands of Chiapas their popularity only increased. The other day I did a test. As I walked the three and a half blocks from our apartment to breakfast I snapped a photo of every VW bug that I saw, which I am including here for your enjoyment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey!  Let&#39;s take the scooters out and see the caves, Las Grutas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Shelley, the owner of &lt;a title=&quot;Croozy Scooters&quot; href=&quot;https://croozyscooters.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Croozy Scooters&lt;/a&gt;, got us -- consisting of Bryn, Mandy, Shelley&#39;s son Justin, his sweetie Sam, and Shelley -- all fitted out with scooters and helmets, and away we went through the streets of San Cristobal and out to the highway out of town.  Beautiful ride, once we left the city traffic, and we cruised on down the road, with Mandy in the lead since she knew where we were going.  At one point Mandy and Bryn looked back and decided to pull over and wait to see if the rest would catch up from whatever delayed them.  Soon, here they came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelley and Ozzie all snug like a hot dog! Shelley, Justin, and Sam catching up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went quite some way out of town and took the exit for Las Grutas and paid our 5 pesos each to get into the park.  The ride through the woods on a gravel road, alone, was worth the trip.  We parked and locked up our bikes and explored the little park.  They have some tall slides made of concrete with lots of kids sliding down on little butt-sized pieces of cardboard and then running back up to the top.  Many people opt for a horseback ride into the wooded areas.  Very inexpensive here.  Others hike.  There are many taco shops, quesadilla shops, other food shops all in a row under the big shelter, so we had lunch after the cave walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought our tickets to see the cave for 10 pesos each (75 cents) and trooped inside.  I expected some cute little cave like a gang of Texas outlaws might hole up in, hiding from the sheriff.  This was actually a large cave with active water deposits being made and stalactites and stalagmites and pools, some lit up with electric lights.  It had a wide path with heavy bright railings.  Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caves go quite a way further, but it goes beneath a military base, so there is a blockage.  Probably good since they also have artillery practice all the time, entertaining us with many explosions.  Mexicans sure do love their explosions (referring to all the heavy firework aerial bombs we&#39;re entertained with nightly and in the mornings at 6:00 and all hours in between)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We emerged from the caves and had a nice quesadilla lunch and we were on our way.  The trip back was going so well, and we had almost made it back to town when disaster hit.  Sam was third in line, I was behind her, and Shelley was bringing up the rear.  Sam got a little far off onto the shoulder and hit some deep gravel, going all out on the scooter downhill, probably 40-45 mph, she fishtailed, got &amp;quot;the wobble&amp;quot;, and flashed out toward the far oncoming lane, but she spun around and crashed in our lane.  Thankfully all the vehicles behind us had just passed us up so no squishing happened.  She lost a lot of skin on both palms and had some road rash on her forearm, side, and some on her leg and foot.  Shelley and I were almost panicking, and she was the one holding it together as she had me pour water on the palms to get the dirt off.  Then Shelley tore up a towel and wrapped her up.  About this time Mandy and Justin decided something was wrong and came back.  We managed to get Sam back into town and return to pick up her scooter.  She&#39;s one tough chick!  And she stood up and survived the torture the doctor put her through at the hospital!  Can you say alcohol poured on raw live meat!?!   But all is well, and she&#39;s nearly healed now, and she has a great story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story:  Don&#39;t get into gravel and wear helmet AND GLOVES when riding motorcycles, scooter, and bicycles!  If she&#39;d had a jacket on, most of the road rash could also have been avoided.  But we all just opted on the helmets that day.  Dress for the wreck and then don&#39;t have one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All&#39;s well that ends well!  Cheers!   She&#39;s one tough chick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the whole set of photos:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Acapulco!</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Acapulco has always held an allure for me.  My parents honeymooned there in the early &#39;50s.  I had an image of the place, expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those expectations have been dashed a bit, but it was still quite a place.  Acapulco Bay is just gorgeous.  Beautiful calm waters, boats moored, nice sunsets and sunrises.  We stayed in the old part of town, preferring to experience the real thing instead of opting for the big new hotels and resorts frequented by the new jet set with lots of money.  Our hotel was reasonably nice and cheap and across the street from the bay -- and a surprise on the other side of the hotel entranceway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/43489455135/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1859/43489455135_a85f14fd97_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/44347794832/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1889/44347794832_f21cdc3b4c_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view was superb however, both early and late.  And we were up early because the colorful, neon-decorated buses and taxis start honking to greet the morning at 6 a.m. sharp -- all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/42588384460/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1866/42588384460_bc990f8cbf_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/30528976928/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1897/30528976928_6fd76f6635_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had dinner at a pizzeria in El Zocalo, which used to be the main square in the city. Now it&#39;s kind of a park with restaurants, ice cream, and the large church, Nuestra Señora de la Soledad.  It is also home to some fantastic trees with incredible trunk structure.  And if you need your shoes shined, there are at least a dozen shoe-shine stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/42588280310/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1881/42588280310_a6034488c2_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous Acapulco La Quebrada Cliff Divers are a must-see to truly experience this town. They have been doing it since well before 1934 when the organization was formed, and they have several shows daily and nightly.  We hiked up there earlier in the day to see the area and snap some pictures and then returned that night for the show.  The hike from the diving location back to our hotel was an easy one, but we opted for a taxi to get up there for only a couple of dollars. Admission is very cheap, three dollars plus or minus, if I remember correctly.  The old Mirador Hotel is still a popular place to eat, see a show with retro native and Folklorico dancers, and then watch the divers.  We watched the divers from a balcony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/43489287815/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1861/43489287815_3bd3b7e8b2_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/43679699364/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1898/43679699364_baa55c0a4b_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divers come out in their speedos and dive out into the inlet from the lower observation area, swim over to the other side and climb up the 125-foot cliff barefoot.  They start young.  Hard to tell, but early to mid teens I think.  They all climb up to the top and ask for protection from the Virgin Mary creche, then the younger ones descend to their lower dive spots on the cliffside.  One at a time they are announced.  Each waits, judging the depth of the water as the waves swell and recede so that they don&#39;t hit bottom, then plunge in with whatever type of dive they choose.  Finally, it&#39;s the star of the show&#39;s turn to make the plunge from the 125-foot height.  He prays a couple extra times before he mounts the rock. The lights are turned off and the other divers climb down to the waters edge on the other side and light torches.   Breaths are held until he hurls himself out as far from the rock as he can and summersaults into the angry water below.  He emerges from the water, waving to the crowds.  Another successful show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/44396923961/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1852/44396923961_9080c8ae4a_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/29459851947/in/album-72157700840824825/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1897/29459851947_d774a980c5_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to discover that in all of the thousands of dives performed here, no one has ever been seriously injured, although there have been a few broken limbs. It is nice to think of my parents here, watching the same divers at the same location so many years ago. Glad to see that at least a few things here in Acapulco have resisted change.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Puerto Escondido</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/puerto-escondido-2/"/>
		<updated>2012-08-24T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/puerto-escondido-2/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;House sit? On a private beach? At a yoga retreat that hasn&#39;t opened yet? There are calm rock pools to swim in out of the crashing surf? The work part is to walk the dogs on the beach and feed them and the cats? OH, YEAH! So after concluding our house sit in Chapala, we made our way across the large landscape that is Mexico. Our visas were to expire before the house sit concluded, so we needed to get to Guatemala for three days so that we would have another 180 days in Mexico. On the way, we stopped in to visit the current house sitter and see our future new digs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the destruction that was Hurricane Carlotta left most of the poor village of Puerticito with only shells of homes, La Joya Yoga Retreat didn&#39;t look too bad. It was mostly cleaned up, though many repairs still needed to be done and the sand road was barely passable in several areas. We spent an hour or two out there with Fiona looking at and experiencing the place we planned to live for the month of August. I won&#39;t go into great detail, but the place was a bit more rustic than we were prepared for, though our pictures make it look perfectly beautiful. The website got me prepared for upscale rustic, but the hurricane took the upscale out of the picture. But the real kicker, the thing that made us back out of the deal, was the oppressive, wet heat. We&#39;re from Texas and experience many 100+ F days every summer, but it was nothing compared to the soppy, wet heat on the southern Mexico coast in summer. The retreat had no fans except over the bed, and that would be mostly blocked by the mosquito netting. Daytime, with surprisingly little breeze coming off the water, there would be no escaping the heat, not to mention the salt and sand that would be sticking to you in the muggy air combined with copious amounts of sweat. Still, we gave it a couple days before even mentioning to each other that we were waffling. It&#39;s the beach! Surely we&#39;d warm to the idea and all would be fine; we&#39;d already committed to the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we went back the half hour into the &amp;quot;big city&amp;quot; of Puerto Escondido to stay a few days and enjoy the surfer vibe and beach life. We had stayed the first night in Hotel Rubi. We couldn&#39;t resist, since it was a nice inexpensive place sporting the name of our former charge in Chapala -- if you&#39;ll remember, the lovely Rubi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7852285936&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Hotel Rubi exterior&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Hotel Rubi exterior&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8296/7852285936_7461041995_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hotel Rubi exterior&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7852353582&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7852353582_ca11d5d6ea_n.jpg&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7852353582_ca11d5d6ea_n.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7852353582_ca11d5d6ea_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7852353582_ca11d5d6ea_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the Hotel Rubi was a bit far from the beach action, so we moved to the last hotel on the surfer beach, La Playa Zicatela, to the Papaya Surf Beach Hotel. It was cheap, about $30 a night, and right across the road from the big crashing waves. Most definitely not a swimming beach but great for surfing, many waves creating the tube surfers love to catch -- but it comes with an undertow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early mornings on an open beach were very nice. The waves usually didn&#39;t start getting high till the sun was well up, and the beach was never crowded. Lovely. But HOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7852350348&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Roxi plays in the sand by the surf&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Roxi plays in the sand by the surf&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7128/7852350348_c319be0574_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Roxi plays in the sand by the surf&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7852320052&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7852320052_3fd8342999_n.jpg&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7852320052_3fd8342999_n.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7852320052_3fd8342999_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7852320052_3fd8342999_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 11:00, the heat would get oppressive and we mostly stayed in our room since it had an air-conditioner. Once we tried taking our computers to this beautiful bar on the beach under a thick palapa. We enjoyed the sound of the waves and the atmosphere, but the heat got to us by about 12:30 and we had to retreat to our room, hot and grumpy. That was when we were convinced we could not take the house sit and had to back out. There just weren&#39;t enough pluses at the retreat to be able to survive the heat. We proved we just aren&#39;t beach bum material. Luckily, it&#39;s a place where it was easy to find someone quickly to fill our spot, so it worked out for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We loved our stay in Puerto Escondido, mornings going to breakfast and evenings going to dinner. The food was good and inexpensive, and the energy of the surfer beach was invigorating. We shopped a little for beach clothing and explored the area. One morning as I sat alone on the beach, one of the many local starving stray dogs came over and parked himself a couple feet away. He was so pitifully skinny. He would watch as people went by with their plump, happy dogs taking a morning jaunt, but nobody loved and cared for him. Glenn joined us for a minute, and then we walked to breakfast. My doggie companion must have known we&#39;d be good for a snack, because he followed us to the restaurant and stayed nearby. We put some leftover refried beans and eggs in the two extra tortillas, and Glenn gave them to him across the street. Stray dogs don&#39;t have a good life in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wonderful cement walkway that winds its way around the coastline to the different beaches. We decided to walk it one evening, and it took almost an hour. Beautiful! The sign at the end says &amp;quot;A Possible Dream.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>San Cristobal, Guatemala and … China?</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/san-cristobal-guatemala-and-china/"/>
		<updated>2012-08-27T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/san-cristobal-guatemala-and-china/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/08/SanCris-Guat.jpg%22&quot; alt=&quot;SanCris Guat&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago we reached a milestone, the end of our first six months in Mexico. We can&#39;t believe it has been that long already! Six months is also the standard time limit for a tourist visa. In order to extend your stay, you have to spend at least seventy-two hours outside the country before re-entry, at which time you can renew your visa for another six months. So that is what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/08/SanCris-Guat-1.jpg%22&quot; alt=&quot;SanCris Guat  1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took an all-day shuttle which dropped us off at the border after making sure all of our passports and visas were stamped out. Then we simply walked down the street to the Guatemalan side of town and had them stamp us all in. After that, we got into a different shuttle and finished the trip to Panajachel. We stayed in Pana for three nights and visited a couple of the other towns on Lake Atitlan while we were there. Bryn will post a full trip report with lots of pictures real soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left we had a few decisions to make. Initially we had planned to just move to Guatemala and stay about 90 days before moving on south, but a few things came up that caused us to hesitate. One brief possibility was a seven month housesitting opportunity in southern France, in the Provence region. Not only is this a part of France we have long wanted to visit, but it is only a couple of hours south of where one of Bryn&#39;s cousins lives, in Lyon. We considered shifting our travel plans and flying to Europe, but there were some obstacles. First, most of Europe is in what is called the Schengen Zone. Your typical tourist visa is for ninety days, and that is for the entire Schengen Zone! If you move around enough and occasionally visit the U.K. you can stretch that out, but it&#39;s tricky. In the end they selected someone else, but we also looked at several other opportunities in southern Spain. We already know basic Spanish, enough to live here for six months, so that is also appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we thought of changing our plans is that there simply aren&#39;t that many housesitting opportunities south of here. A couple in Costa Rica, maybe one in Nicaragua, one in Panama, and… that&#39;s about it! Every housesitting site that we use shows a global map. North America and Europe are just &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; of pins, and quite a few pins are scattered around SouthEast Asia, but South America and Africa are just empty. So if we do continue going south from here we will compensate by living 2-3 months at a time in each place and finding cheap rent. In the meantime we are staying put in San Cristobal. It&#39;s just so nice here, and we have some expat friends, and we&#39;ll be paying about $212 in rent for a studio apartment with a beautiful courtyard, wifi and hot water. The previous tenant is now living here and will leave some furniture for us. We&#39;ll have a small kitchen and fridge and a bathroom all &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the apartment, which ought to be a nice change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/08/shenzhen-night1.jpg%22&quot; alt=&quot;Shenzhen night&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But tomorrow I will be taking a phone call from China. An interesting opportunity came up recently and I applied for it. A couple of expats run a business in Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong. They make all kinds of apparel products and they are going to hire an intern for 90 days. In exchange for 4-5 hours a day, five days a week I would get a free apartment w/ wifi and a stipend, free laundry and lunches most days and possibly a cook! I would be running their website and working with their staff to do some creative stuff with photography and video, plus marketing in general. Tomorrow is a screening call, and I have no idea how many other candidates they are looking at, but hopefully we&#39;ll know by tomorrow night what the possibilities are. Sure, it&#39;s a job, and it is nice to not have to work, but flying to that part of the world is expensive and having a group of people on hand to help you get settled would be a big bonus. And who knows, maybe it turns into something I really love doing and becomes a full-time job? I&#39;m still in China, learning Cantonese! Seems like an adventure to us.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Visit to Guatemala</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since our visas for Mexico were about to expire, we had to take a little trip over the border for at least 72 hours, so we chose the nearest border, Guatemala.  We&#39;d heard good things about Panajachel on Lake Atitlan, so that&#39;s where we decided to head.  Friends told us the best way to go is on a shuttle instead of taking a bus line as one bus line will take you to the border and then you have to pick up another, and you are left to your own devices in accomplishing the border crossing.  With the shuttle, the driver makes sure everyone gets through immigration and onto the shuttle in the next country.  Much easier to avoid all kinds of scams from people offering to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7895464908&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Glenn waits for the shuttle&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8318/7895464908_2ca09b608a_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Glenn waits for the shuttle&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7895466276&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Clouds in the mountains&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8453/7895466276_a2edc2aed3_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Clouds in the mountains&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive in the Mexican countryside was just beautiful, and we arrived at the border crossing around noon.  The crossing went smoothly, except for one guy that had overstayed his visa and had to go find an ATM to get enough cash to pay the daily fines.  We were then driven about 10 minutes to the actual border and pointed toward the entry station for Guatemala where we walked over with all our luggage and got stamped in with a visa for Guatemala.  Our new driver was waiting and got us all safely into his van and we were off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/7895470854&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Waiting to go to our Guatemalan shuttle&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8316/7895470854_bd8c7d10a2_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Waiting to go to our Guatemalan shuttle&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenery was equally beautiful, green jungle and croplands butting up together.  The fields went right up the steepest mountain slopes, some terraced, some not.  Lots of corn.  Right off, I noticed that Guatemalan women almost all wear the traditional skirt and top, similar to that of the indigenous women in San Cristobal; and unlike San Cris, it&#39;s very common for them to carry their heavy loads balanced on their heads.  The indigenous in San Cris usually wrap their loads and/or their babies in their rebozos on their backs and tied diagonally around their torsos.  The Guatemalans do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived in Panajachel and after checking 3 hotels on the main drag, elected to stay at Hotel Chaparral.  Pretty place and a huge 2nd-floor room with 3 full-size beds was about $22 US a night.  Internet was included, but it only worked well out on the bench outside our room, though that&#39;s a pleasant place to be.  Also down on the table in the courtyard.  Ahhh!  We had a nice steak dinner and wine at a little restaurant down the road.  We spent more than we intended, since the Quetzal is worth double the Peso and we didn&#39;t check, but the food was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we decided to stroll down and see this beautiful lake we&#39;d heard about, the biggest in Guatemala, sporting 3 volcanos around the edge.  Truly beautiful!  In the mornings the water is so calm and serene, and we watched launches and fishing boats and dugout canoes traversing.  Afternoon trips are a bit more exciting as the winds pick up and the lake gets wavy.  If you&#39;re prone to motion sickness, come back home early!  Myself, I loved it all and insisted my window be open even if I was getting splashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked around and explored and figured out the launch situation and decided to go to San Marcos the next morning.  There is a river that enters the lake near the docks.  Lots of guys working separating gravel from little river rock to bigger rocks for sale for construction and gardens.  The river had come through at some point and ripped huge pieces of bank out, including some buildings and roads.  We had a nice exploratory walk around town and on the main drag.  We discovered the people selling things to tourists in Pana are extremely persistent compared to the indigenous in San Cris.  Instead of going to the next person after you say, No, gracias, they pester you for a while to see if they can wear you down.  Guess it works on some or they wouldn&#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lady who spotted me and made a bee line to the back of the restaurant just would not go away, so I offered her a Quetzal for a picture.  She got all huffy and said that a Quetzal &amp;quot;no compra nada!&amp;quot; (doesn&#39;t buy anything).  She wanted 10Q, but I finally convinced her for 5 Q.  She let Glenn test the weight of her head bundle, and he said it weighed about 20 pounds!  These ladies do work hard walking all day with their arms laden with textiles and more in the bundle on their head.  I had finally just accepted the fact that the street sellers were part of the tourist experience so I could interact with them and not be intimidated.  Another lady who spoke some English said, &amp;quot;Oh, I remember you, how are you?  What&#39;s your name?&amp;quot; all friendly-like.  When I still wouldn&#39;t buy her stuff, she said, &amp;quot;Never buy!&amp;quot; and turned around and strode away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caught the launch to San Marcos to explore that town on the second morning.  We were &amp;quot;serenaded&amp;quot; by a guy practicing his rap tunes with his iPod in his ears.  Sorry, but, dude, don&#39;t quit your day job!  The launch stopped twice on the way to pick up and deliver passengers.  Seems that about everybody uses them, and the price for locals is about half or less what they charge tourists, which is about $3.75 each for a trip to whatever stop around the edge you choose.  Each stop had what used to be covered deck areas to wait that were about a foot and a half underwater and had new walkways above the water level.  Many who built too close to the water have lost their homes to rising lake levels in recent years, mostly expats that wanted to be too close to the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Marcos had basically one walkway from the docks up to the small town that was lined with New-Age-y shops and various healing centers and some little restaurants.  Very quaint and nice.  We walked around town for about half an hour and saw most of what was there outside the residential areas, and then we had lunch down a little side path on the main walkway.  A little place with two or three tables called Maya Jovenes (Young Maya) that was owned and run by a smart young Mayan guy named Marco who was a wonderful chef and also spoke English pretty well.  Very nice little place to hang out for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, after a rough-and-tumble launch ride back, when we were on our computers, a huge BOOOOOMMMMM  startled us.  Being familiar with the Mexican Catholics and their love of exploding &amp;quot;mortar shells&amp;quot; in the air at all hours, we weren&#39;t alarmed.  I heard a marching band in the distance and went out -- oh, boy, a parade!  It consisted of the marching band from a Christian school and their team of flag girls dancing routines, a van in the lead with loudspeakers to announce whatever -- couldn&#39;t catch anything they said -- and a couple of &amp;quot;floats&amp;quot; with girls on couches in the back of the trucks.  The whole thing moved extremely slowly, so took about a half hour to go by.  Then the band stopped and marched in place and played for literally hours at the far end of the main drag.  How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last day we took the launch over to San Pedro.  This town has a reputation for being sort of a hippie town with lots of pot smoked and laid-back characters around.  It seemed to be a bigger town with fewer tourists and street sellers.  Very nice vibe and lots of nice murals on lots of buildings and shops.  We had lunch at The Burrito Factory run by a hippie-type fellow that lived in the back.  He had a gorgeous deck over the edge of the lake that was his backyard when the restaurant is closed.  He was not kidding that he has the biggest burritos in Guatemala.  We split one and were both absolutely stuffed with his tasty concoction.  We lounged there under the shade and enjoyed the lake for quite a while before leaving to get back before the waves got bad.  Unfortunately, the waves were early, but it was a fun ride.  We agreed that if we go back, we will skip Pana and head straight for San Pedro, maybe stay there a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next morning we had to catch our shuttle at 6:30 a.m. for a beautiful ride back to the border and back home to San Cris with our shiny new visas.  On the drive back I made a game of trying to get pics of the gas stations and their &amp;quot;signs&amp;quot; showing one was up ahead.  If you see a stack of plastic jerrycans of different sizes with prices written on them in marks-a-lot, there&#39;s a &amp;quot;gas station&amp;quot; just ahead.  There are no traditional gas stations outside larger cities.  It seems that families assign young boys to sell gas beside the road.  You can buy a little or a lot, and the kid will run up, pour in your choice, collect the money, and you&#39;re off again.  They have these in Mexico as well, as our taxi bought a small amount of gas this way when we went to Oventic, but in Guatemala they are plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last we arrived back in San Cristobal after another 10-11 hour shuttle ride.  Ahh, home, sweet home -- at least for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;I begin to realize that, here in the state of Chiapas, I am walking around as a fabulously wealthy person among the poorest people in Mexico .  I am as guilty as any vacation tourist of brushing off the vendors, who are trying to support their families, and sometimes treating them as if they are flies on the table.  I walk past maimed or deformed beggars and pretend not to see.  It stings me now to do that.  In America that’s what we do, thinking that those beggars should just go to a mission or a church and get a hot meal and fresh clothing -- there are programs, get off the street ya lazy good-for-nothing -- get a job.  Here there isn’t much of that kind of help.  There is officially universal health care, but not every community has a clinic, and not every Mexican, especially the indigenous people, trust the government. The welfare program gives poor women a monthly stipend for food, but none of this would help a disabled man gain any sort of employment. What if that guy was my dad all alone and begging?  What if that was my mother or my sister over there huddled under a little blanket holding out a cup in the chilly drizzle?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;I see how the indigenous Maya people live here, in villages of small cinder block one- or two-room shacks with metal roofs, cooking on a little open fire inside and breathing the smoke; some have an open-slat room for cooking. They are the hardest-working people I’ve ever seen.  They begin working as soon as they are old enough to be responsible to do something, age 4 or 5, and they work until they die or get maimed or totally disabled and have to beg.  It’s a common sight out in the countryside to see children and old women walking barefoot up the mountain carrying half their weight in firewood on their backs, supported with a strap around their foreheads.  The young girls herd sheep, staking each animal in an area to graze every day and bringing them back.  All the girls and women spin yarn, embroider, weave beautiful things for sale, cook, clean, and the men tend the crops and any large work animals of their village.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Many women, girls, and children sell items in the city, having to approach everybody they can and constantly being brushed off, sometimes hatefully.  Even the Mexicans scorn them, not just the European tourists.  They are treated almost as non-humans and excluded from city life.  The Mexican government wants to give their land and resources that they’ve had for hundreds of years, if not more, to multinational corporations for exploitation, and the Maya don’t want to give it up and be humiliated as charity cases. They want to live their lives, educate their children, live as communities, and not give their little “wealth” to the Mexican government and let corporations come in and steal the natural resources and ruin the land.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;So I have begun to try to be nice and friendly and speak directly to the vendors and say, &amp;quot;No gracias, Senora,&amp;quot; and smile and look them in the eye like they matter as people -- because they do.  I see them constantly treated like pesky insects.  I can’t buy anything unless I want to run out of money since we aren’t making much right now.  If I bought one small thing from everyone I was approached by daily, I would have enough to plaster the walls and floors and fill all the corners to the ceilings with trinkets within a very short time.  Should I give every one a peso?  Should I pick some and give them 10 pesos?  Should I find a place that benefits these people to volunteer time while I’m here?  I’m thinking that would be best, and I can learn about the culture and maybe help out some and also get some insight as to doling out pesos from my “fabulous personal wealth.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;The politics are old and complicated, and the United States has had an ugly hand in all this --  and all around the world.  The more I learn the worse I feel about how my country has handled foreign policy over the last hundred years, not just the last 20.  Our government does horrible, unspeakable things without the knowledge or permission of the citizenry.  I dare say if Americans knew what has been and is being done in our name, we would all be positively outraged because we are basically good people.  But we listen to the rhetoric about being the shining light on the hill, the peacekeepers, the benevolent ones, partners to other countries to make this a better world of freedom, and we don’t examine too closely what is actually the case.  I am outraged and I feel completely helpless and hopeless in the area of our out-of-control bully government, but I’ll leave this subject for another time and place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;For now, enjoy these other pictures from San Cristobal!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Scooters to Chamula and Zinacantan</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&#39;re taking scooters to see the neighboring Tzotzil villages of Chamula and Zinacantan, do you want to come?&amp;quot;  Music to my ears -- road trip!   So the next morning I was off with a local scooter shop owner&#39;s son Justin, his girlfriend Sam, and a bilingual friend.   When visiting interesting places it&#39;s always helpful to have someone who understands the language so you can get questions answered and generally understand better what you&#39;re seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/dcMZvT&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8455/8009736193_bec1abb7cb_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Esteban and Justin and Bryn almost ready&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made it out of town without incident and hit the highway to Chamula.  The countryside was beautiful, and the traffic was light.  There is a large parking area above the Chamula cemetery where we parked and locked up the bikes.  There&#39;s a restaurant there, as well as a few market stalls.  In a Tzotzil cemetery, the color of the cross on the grave tells the approximate age at which the person died:  White crosses grace the graves of children, black ones indicate a middle-age death, and the few gray ones represent those who lived a full lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8009736803&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Chamula cemetery&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8295/8009736803_c565d14094.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chamula cemetery&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early Mayans embraced a complex world of science, particularly astronomy, and religion.  When the Spanish invaded, the result was a mix of Mayan religious practice and Catholicism still practiced today, though many have more recently replaced some Catholic influences with Protestant beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked through the village towards the old church, the centerpiece of the town, situated on a large plaza where markets are held.  There were lots of market stalls even though this was not the main weekly market day.  Along the way we saw mostly plain cinderblock construction houses, but there were a few nicer places and even a huge, new-construction house that I suspect will be the eventual house of the governor.  We even saw a couple of modern-style homes, though these were probably 15-20 years old.  We saw very few tourists that day, but the tourist board had their table set up outside the church door to collect 20 pesos per person to enter.  Apparently the Mayan religious practices are a tourist draw.  No cameras allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8009745966&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Chamula Tzotzil Church&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8451/8009745966_ec0c413861.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chamula Tzotzil Church&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I balked at paying to see yet another big Catholic church, but I was very glad I relented and entered that world.  The culture shock was worth it.  The floor was completely covered with long, grassy, green pine needles.  The floor being marble tile, care must be taken to step carefully, lest you end up on your backside!  There was not a pew or a chair in sight.  The entire place was lit with hundreds of candles on tables and all across the floor, and I was surprised at the heat and smoke.  I stood at the back and looked around to get my bearings and figure out what I was to do, when a man approached.  I think he asked if I wanted a shaman today.  Uh, no, thank you (maybe some other time?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire sanctuary floor was taken up by small family or mother and children groups, a few men, who lit groups of maybe 20-40 tall, thin candles and stuck them to the floor in a square pattern.  Many just sat or chanted quietly, a few not so quietly, before their little array of fire.  Some appeared to have a shaman with them.  Stephanie and Andre (of &lt;a title=&quot;Discovering Ice&quot; href=&quot;https://discoveringice.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discovering Ice&lt;/a&gt;) mentioned that they had seen live chickens being sacrificed here, but we didn&#39;t see any while we visited.  I did see a few people with eggs.  Esteban said they pass an egg over your body for some type of cleansing or healing.  After a group is finished, they scrape the candle wax off the floor so the next group will have a clean space to begin. This picture of a side chapel with candles on the floor isn&#39;t from here in Chamula, but it is representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8009743972&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Tzotzil candles in a side chapel&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8169/8009743972_9c883d85bc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tzotzil candles in a side chapel&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we slowly walked around the perimeter, up to the front and around, we noticed that the entire outer wall had wood and glass boxes of many sizes, each containing a statue of a different saint, and tables in front covered with votive and taller glass candles.  The front altar area was just more of the same but with a large statue of Mary, no Jesus on the cross.  By the time we got to the front, we had started to sweat from the heat the candles were producing, so we walked a little faster on the way out.  It was well worth stopping in to visit this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed back up the hill to our scooters and took off toward the next village of Zinacantan, drinking in the big mountains and valleys and observing the inhabitants along the way.  If you drive in the countryside, you&#39;re always going to see at least one group of girls and their sheep and old women and youngsters carrying huge loads of wood and other necessities on their backs, supported by a strap around their forehead. The children in the yards love to wave at us as we zip by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering Zinacantan, we were stopped and asked to pay a tourist fee of 5 pesos each at a little tourist building.  Then we drove through to the main square and parked.  Three or four young girls all ran up and were asking if we spoke Spanish.  Esteban already knew one girl, whose name was Lucia, so we went with her to her home.  Apparently home tours are &amp;quot;the thing&amp;quot; in this village.  We walked past a huge, bright orange and white building.  I asked about it and was told it is the governor&#39;s mansion.  An opulent, fabulous place compared to virtually all the other buildings and homes in the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8009742751&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Zincanatan&#39;s governor&#39;s house&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8032/8009742751_61d520043e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zincanatan&#39;s governor&#39;s house&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently we arrived at Lucia&#39;s home, and she invited us in.  The main room was lined with textile products, handmade scarves, rebozos, hats, belts, blankets, and traditional clothing for sale.  Grandmother appeared and donned her strap loom and demonstrated her weaving technique.  The scarf she was working on takes about eight days to make, working about eight hours a day.  Justin bought one of those for her asking price of 180 pesos, just under $14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8009742227&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Lucia&#39;s house&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8440/8009742227_1d60664e82.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lucia&#39;s house&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucia asked if someone would like to try on the traditional Tzotzil skirt, belt, shirt, and shawl, so of course I volunteered.  All the fabrics were very heavy, though not uncomfortable.  I asked her mother if all this was handmade, and she said completely, the fabric woven and all the embroidery is hand done.  I have seen women around San Cristobal doing some of the embroidery, and it is amazing.  I don&#39;t know what the asking price for these things are, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a pittance compared to even machine-made similar items back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we were ushered to the kitchen or at least where open-fire cooking is done.  We didn&#39;t inquire if there was another room for cooking.  Lucia&#39;s mother sat on the floor next to the fire with a large round metal tortilla-cooking pan.  She had a bowl of corn dough and a wooden tortilla press.  She made several fresh delicious tortillas for us that we could fill with a lovely salsa, ground pumpkin seeds, and fresh, homemade cheese sprinkles from a low table.  The corn was even grown in their own plot out back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it was an amazing experience to get a small glimpse into Mayan life.  Outside we encountered a hen and several chicks by the roadside, and as we drove out of town we met a turkey hen and chicks that was not bothered by our presence.  In fact, we had seen several lone chickens around town by the road of different breeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortified by our tortilla snack, we boarded our scooters and headed back to San Cristobal.  The rain clouds were already threatening and we hoped -- to no avail -- that we would make it home before they cut loose.  Nearly back to town, we had to take shelter under a porch of a vacant house for half an hour.  After that, we made it back to within a few blocks before another downpour, with nowhere to go but back to the shop, drenched but laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the rest of the pictures from the trip -- enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>October 2 -- A Sad Day to Remember</title>

		<id>https://vagabondians.com/october-2-a-sad-day-to-remember/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.78333282470703px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.78333282470703px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;2 October protest marches remembering the &amp;quot;1968 massacre, a day on which Mexican soldiers violently repressed a rally organized by the student-led National Strike Commission (CNH) in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco district of Mexico City.  The exact number of victims left by the massacre is still unknown, although social organizations estimate that around 300 people were killed.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“43 years after the Tlatelolco massacre, the behavior of the Mexican State has been the constant repression against those who raise their voice for justice and access to a dignified life.  The policies of the government are the exploitation and robbery of natural resources to benefit capitalist interests, leaving thousands of peoples and communities impoverished.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I heard a crowd chanting and I ran out to catch a protest march of the students.  I walked with them and shot photos and video as we made our way from the big indigenous market to the center of the city.  Many of the young adults wore scarves or balaclavas, Zapatista style, to hide their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a rough translation that I did online of a flyer a boy handed to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As FNLS, we have been on indefinite sit from the August 25 without any response to our just demands require a halt to the violence of state, halt to the systematic violation of human rights, freedom of political prisoners, not more extrajudicial killings, halt to the entry of transnational corporations, halt the plundering of our natural resources and minerals, for the defense of the free and public education, etc. Denounce all the atrocities committed by the traders associations in turn against the Mexican people, it is a necessity and a duty of all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is already fulfils the six years of Felipe Calderon and Juan Sabines, both with a policy of repression, mass and selective. At the national level, with the pretext of the war against organized crime and drug trafficking have been massacred to the worker, more than 100 thousand extrajudicial killings, 40 thousand disappeared detainees by political and social grounds, 100 thousand prisoners and political prisoners, who are in the prisons of maximum and medium security serving a sentence without reasons, crimes that the state has perpetrated by the only decent and just done to defend a livelihood by this, we have been crossed out of criminals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your explicit permission as Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Luis Echeverría, Calos Salinas, Ernesto Cedillo, Vicente Fox, Felipe Calderon, etc. , and now Enrique Peña Nieto in the presidency of Mexico and Manuel Velasco Coello in the governorship of Chiapas have been and will be the representatives of the tireless business interests national and international, always defend the interests of the oligarchy, following in the footsteps of the foot of the letter the mandates of imperialist countries such as the United States, claiming as the sole objective in combat while people organized and unorganized to be mobilised by so much misery that there is to the length and breadth of the country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***The massacres perpetrated against students on 2 October 1968, in the plaza de las tres Culturas, Tlatelolco, on June 10, 1971, El Bosque, Aguas Blancas, El Charco, Acetal, Wolonchan, Viejo Velasco, Chinkultik, have side the responses to the demands of the Mexican people. The militarization and paramilitarization is seen with increase in Chiapas ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The paramilitary bands do the dirty work of the government and gangraping disappearing to peasant men and women, the military patrols in the peasant and indigenous communities, in every street in the cities, intimidating, stopping and disappearing to men and women of different ages by their physical appearance, by being poor, humble by his clothes, labeling us as potential offenders, suspects, criminalizing popular protest and poverty. We demand the end to the harassment, imprisonment, the repression and aggression toward our comrades in the different communities that comprise the FNLS, by the military and paramilitary bands organized and financed by Juan Sabines and Felipe Calderon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punishment to the works of the violent eviction from our comrades in the Cologne popular Miguel Hidalgo in Ocosingo, by the paramilitary group of the ORCAO members, the aggression of companions of the OCEZ -- House of the people in Venustiano Carranza by the paramilitary group led and financed by Jesus Orantes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation with life of Edmundo Reyes Amaya, Gabriel Alberto Cruz Sanchez, Francisco Paredes Ruiz and of all the missing people on political and social grounds!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For workers&#39; unity, canpesina, indigenous and popular!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Front in the Struggle for Socialism (FNLS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my birthday in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, I decided I wanted us to walk to a local attraction, the orchid and botanical conservatory and nature trail.  It was an adventure, starting with finding the place.  Google maps showed it to be about a 15-minute walk from our apartment in San Cristobal. The exact location shown was off by about a half mile, but a quick question to a local helped us find it.  It was a beautiful garden area with a lagoon and little benches and quaint decorative &amp;quot;hobbit&amp;quot; bridges over small runoff streams.  As we began to walk around, we were intercepted by the caretaker, who was a friendly Mayan guy named &amp;quot;Shoon,&amp;quot; or in Spanish, Juan.  He speaks three languages, his Mayan tongue, Spanish, and a good bit of English.  He led us around and pointed out different plants and then to his &amp;quot;office&amp;quot; to sign in and pay our 30 pesos each to see the orchid greenhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8000310053&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;View of the garden and lagoon&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8439/8000310053_6dee65b6de.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View of the garden and lagoon&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8000265766&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;We signed in and paid our $30 pesos each&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8301/8000265766_f689d4be9a_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We signed in and paid our $30 pesos each&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed him into the greenhouse, where it was quite tropical (read: hot and humid) and filled with ferns and bromeliads and orchids of all sizes.  He led us down the paths and pointed out all the tiny Chiapas orchids we would have totally missed and told us things about all the plants.  There was even a big orchid that smelled like flowers coated in chocolate.  When we had sweat enough, he led us out and pointed out the trail and explained there&#39;s a cave and some things we didn&#39;t quite catch with our broken understanding of Spanish.  I had heard there were some unexcavated ruins out there somewhere as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8000267061&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;The orchid greenhouse&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/8000267061_7f91bcb0ea_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The orchid greenhouse&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8000268523&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Very tropical and humid&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8178/8000268523_6ee60cfa49_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Very tropical and humid&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we didn&#39;t quite come prepared for our adventure.  The trail wound around the garden and then headed steeply up the mountain behind us with long switchbacks.  We had no idea how long the trail would be but didn&#39;t think it would be much, so off we went.  There were more bromeliads and flowers along the trail and interesting plants.  We started seeing great views over San Cristobal and the mountains, and I was wishing I&#39;d brought my binoculars -- and some bottles of water.  But we took our time and enjoyed the hike through the mountainside oak forest.  The trail was very well marked the entire way, but we had no idea if it was up and back down or if it was a loop.  We finally started to anticipate the top of the mountain when we came to a big cave that dropped off into the ground.  There were steps and a rail to go down a little and try to peer inside, which of course we did, but we couldn&#39;t see the exact opening was located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8000283975&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Beginning of the trail&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/8000283975_be50a3d389_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beginning of the trail&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8000302404&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;View partway up the front mountain on the trail&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8309/8000302404_c087dd77ca_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View partway up the front mountain on the trail&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8000310766&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;Nice hike&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8179/8000310766_974b5354d8_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nice hike&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired and thirsty and not sure how much further the trail went before it either stopped or headed back, we decided to press on.  If we go back, the trail is steep and a bit slick in places for going down, but going forward turned out to be just a nice descent around the back of the mountain and around and back to the beginning.  There are side trails, but the trail markers are frequent and very clear, and the trail is very well maintained.  When we got back to the main area, we took time to wander around and enjoy the beautiful day and idyllic garden before the sunny walk back home.  We thought about catching a collective or taxi back, but walking won out since the easy walk down the mountain allowed us to refresh and enjoy the air. Whew, made it -- guess I&#39;m not as old as it sounds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a rest it was time to go party with our expat friends here, dinner at Cocoliche and then a few drinks at the local wine bar.  Someone even brought little cakes and auto-relighting candles for the occasion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having now held a huge tarantula in my hand and on my shoulder, I felt compelled to visit her home, the Museo de los Bichos -- no, not what you think -- it means museum of bugs or small animals!  So off I went, empowered as a spider handler.  I paid the 25 peso entrance fee (&amp;lt; $2 US), and then I entered.  They had a nice little garden courtyard with 3-4 rooms around it with cases of pinned insects, spiders, and scorpions and posters explaining fascinating facts for children.  Some rooms had aquariums housing tarantulas or Madagascar hissing cockroaches or other interesting &amp;quot;bichos.&amp;quot;  It&#39;s a great place to introduce someone to the great variety of creepy-crawlies on our blue planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8056817213&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/8056817213_6125c91b9b_n.jpg&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/8056817213_6125c91b9b_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/8056817213_6125c91b9b_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8056824276&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8174/8056824276_352920cd95_n.jpg&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8174/8056824276_352920cd95_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8174/8056824276_352920cd95_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8056823869&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8169/8056823869_182de5e838_n.jpg&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8169/8056823869_182de5e838_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8169/8056823869_182de5e838_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One case had several shed exoskeletons of tarantulas, and that intrigued me, so I found this fascinating little video about what you&#39;re seeing inside a tarantula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Museo del Jade is located just down the street from the bug museum, so after seeing some beautiful shiny green beetles, Jade was the logical next stop.  The fee here was higher, 30 pesos (~ $2.35 US), but it was well worth it.  Just the entryway was very informing and colorfully well done.  The lady handed me a little notebook of all the exhibit case explanations in English, and I was off.  The exhibit went in order from the early Olmecs to the Toltecs and on through time to the Maya and the Aztecs, each with their unique carvings and fabulous jewelry of the rulers.  One exhibit had three hanging rectangular plates, and the back of the middle one has my birthday, Sept. 13, 320 B.C., on it, so of course I had to take the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8056908231&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8317/8056908231_3aab4f67b3_n.jpg&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8317/8056908231_3aab4f67b3_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8317/8056908231_3aab4f67b3_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last exhibit was a mock-up of the tomb of a great ruler at Palenque, Pakal.  For protection of the tomb, the original is no longer open to the public.  See the picture of the explanation page for more details of that exhibit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8056913011&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8455/8056913011_28f0e82ca9.jpg&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8455/8056913011_28f0e82ca9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8455/8056913011_28f0e82ca9.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8056914444&quot; title=&quot;View &#39;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/8056914444_e3dff6bb91_n.jpg&#39; on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/8056914444_e3dff6bb91_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/8056914444_e3dff6bb91_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Confessions of a Closet Schemer</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/confessions-of-a-closet-schemer/"/>
		<updated>2012-10-16T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/confessions-of-a-closet-schemer/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We did a lot of work and planning before we quit our jobs. We often refer to what we are doing as having &#39;run away from home.&#39; It&#39;s a bit of a joke, but there is some truth to it. But we did sell all of our things. We got out of our home and mortgage and moved into a small apartment. We quit our jobs. We traveled half of the U.S. and later sold our final possessions and vehicles. We got down to a few suitcases. This was a monumental shift from the average American lifestyle, and it didn&#39;t happen overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of this process we were in a holding pattern. We could have continued indefinitely at the &#39;employed&#39; stage but we finally pulled the trigger after many spreadsheets and calculations. The one hole in it all, the one fly in the ointment: money. We had some, but the spreadsheets showed that we would need a bit of luck and some extra income on the side, on the road. So we took off while a few ideas were still in-progress and with nothing guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are still in one of these stages, let me give you some friendly advice here. Most of the time we encourage people to stop waiting, to get off their couch and do something. We don&#39;t want you to wait until you are seventy-five before you realize that you wish you had seen more of the world. But sometimes you really do need to wait. The best (and only) time to wait is right before you quit your job. Once you disconnect from that source of income everything changes. So before you pull the trigger, be sure that you have a good plan and are reasonably well-positioned financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/10/get_rich.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;get rich&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, our plan had some holes in it. The good news is that we have savings to fall back on. The bad news is that we threw some of it away on what I am now referring to as schemes. Here is a brief list of our on-the-road income attempts to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[NOTE: In all of these cases, you can find both resellers of services and individuals who will swear up and down that these strategies work and work well. In our case, they all failed spectacularly]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- niche web sites -- you attempt to get your sites ranked high in the search engines, which provides traffic that can bring in advertising revenue through (usually) Google Adsense. Keywords and backlinks and spun articles, oh my!&lt;br&gt;
-- ecommerce -- Selling &#39;dropship&#39; items on our web site and eBay&lt;br&gt;
-- Gold -- both paper and coin investments&lt;br&gt;
-- Stock market&lt;br&gt;
— mechanical investing (late 90&#39;s)&lt;br&gt;
— options (mainly Apple stock, 2009)&lt;br&gt;
— option spreads and iron condors (2010)&lt;br&gt;
— high yield premium REIT dividend stocks (2012)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these but one are something which I would now categorically refer to as a scheme. The other (ecommerce) is closer to a real plan, but we ran it like a scheme and never intended to take the time and effort to do the administrative support work. We have been looking for something automated, something we could set and forget. We wanted to bypass traditional blood, sweat and tears. We were looking for the ever-elusive holy grail of passive residual income. We&#39;re still looking...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this is that we were attempting to shorten the traditional timeframe, where one works for the majority of their life and then quits their job and moves right into the retirement home. Yes, I know I&#39;m exaggerating a bit there, but when you shorten the timeframe significantly (a.k.a., early retirement) and you aren&#39;t already rich, you have to save up a lot of money or work a non-traditional job on the road. All of our scheming has been in an attempt to avoid the latter, actual employment -- working for someone else at their beck and call. It has always been something we have viewed as a fallback position, something we wished to avoid, a true last resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that the first step towards recovery is to admit that you have a problem. I am acknowledging the problem right now: schemes! I&#39;m done with them. It&#39;s time that I admit that they just don&#39;t work for me. I&#39;ll leave it to others to determine the underlying causes. It is either because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A -- All of my attempts were truly get-rich-quick schemes and rarely work for anyone (see &#39;investor psychology&#39;);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B -- My attempts were legitimate but require exquisite timing or great luck or some other intangible;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C -- My attempts were legitimate but require a special type of personality; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D -- Everything I tried is not only legitimate but works for the vast majority of people. I simply have a truly bad combination of personality or aptitude which causes every attempt to always fail on a grand scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been unable to determine which of these is the case. While I suspect A, it is possible that the answer is D and that I am unable to see this because I am too close to the problem. In the end, it doesn&#39;t matter. I have given them all a full-press, long-term attempt and the results were dangerous to our long-term finances. I must move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads to the question: What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slightly more traditional approach, for sure. But before we start filling out job applications, we have plenty of other options. Most of them attempt to leverage our existing skill sets and involve freelancing or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my wife&#39;s part, our original plan had her doing some work for her ex-coworkers. She has done some of that, and it pays pretty good, but work availability started off sporadic and then went downhill from there. She also attempted some video transcriptions based on a referral, but that turned out to be much more work for less pay than we had hoped (with a lot of technical glitches thrown in) and we had to pass it on to someone else. We still have some options here, but we haven&#39;t fully explored them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I will need to leverage my I.T. and web site/database experience. I&#39;ve started a site for the business (iPrioriti) and I recently helped a local business get online and am currently working on another WordPress site for a friend. Additionally, an opportunity has opened up to teach some basic PC skills classes here in San Cristobal de las Casas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have our travel blog. We have had a few people pay us for backlink articles or sidebar links, but we don&#39;t have the traffic yet for much of that. It does, however, give us a platform for a mailing list and publicizing our eBooks as we write them. We also occasionally review products and then link to them via affiliate links. So far the income from this has been minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we may even end up looking into the one job many travelers seek out when things get tight: teaching English! When combined with living in a country with low expenses, it could offset most if not all of our budget. Certificates are generally required, and that costs some money, but not too much in the &#39;scheme&#39; of things. It also fits well with our slow travel, living for a time in each country we like and getting to know the locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are our current plans, and frankly they should have been our focus all along. But at least we are, indeed, now fully focused on them, leaving the schemes behind — hopefully for the last time. In the meantime we still have savings in the bank and the expenses in Mexico are low. Every morning we wake up and decide what we want to do for the day, and it&#39;s hard to put a price tag on that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://vagabondians.com/dia-de-los-muertos-computador/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/macbookairflatlined.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2140 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/macbookairflatlined.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;macbookairflatlined&quot; width=&quot;259&quot; height=&quot;194&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  A few weeks ago, just as Bryn was heading out for a week-long adventure in the jungles of Palenque with her friend Loretta, her MacBook Air began experiencing problems. By the time she tried to import her first set of photos it wouldn&#39;t stay powered on long enough to log in. It was obviously possessed. That was just the beginning of several days of tech frustration. Bryn had almost 1,000 photos and no way to save them. In the end, she convinced Loretta to sign up for a Dropbox account and the photos slowly uploaded to their server over several days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/dia-de-los-muertos-computador/priest/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2138  aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Did Someone Call for an Exorcist?&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/priest.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Did Someone Call for an Exorcist?&quot; width=&quot;258&quot; height=&quot;195&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she returned to San Cristobal de las Casas, I began working on it. As usual, I started the process by asking &amp;quot;What did you DO to it?&amp;quot; LOL I tried several different ways of logging on: safe mode, recovery partition, booting off of a USB stick. I checked and &#39;repaired&#39; the solid state hard drive. Eventually I gave up and pulled all of Bryn&#39;s files off onto an external drive and reinstalled OS X. This changed nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I gave up and took it in to a Mac repair shop in Tuxtla. Their official diagnosis: logic board. For a mere $850 USD they would replace it. [NOTE: Had I not somehow missed the deadline to extend the AppleCare warranty, this would have been a free repair] Given the fact that a brand new unit starts at $1000 with a full one-year warranty we decided not to have the repairs done. Since then we have decided to sell it for parts and replace it with an iPad and wireless keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime we haven&#39;t updated the blog, as you probably noticed. One reason is that I was busy working on Bryn&#39;s laptop while using my own for research. Bryn was stuck with her iPod. After diagnosing her laptop issues, I decided that I really, REALLY needed to get my own laptop backups all caught up. And that&#39;s when my backup hard drive died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that was fun. Any way, I found a decently priced replacement drive at a local shop and spent a few days reprocessing my photos, which included moving them into a new folder structure, running a renaming app on all of them and then reimporting them into Aperture. All 30,000+ pictures. After that I ran a new backup on my external drive, and made a bootable clone of my MacBook Air&#39;s hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we didn&#39;t lose any data. The bad news is that we could have! I was already working on a new, revamped all-encompassing backup strategy, but it was not in place yet. It will be, soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, dear reader, is why we haven&#39;t posted anything in awhile. We didn&#39;t have any photos or video from the Palenque trip, and our one working laptop was in heavy use for reorganization and backups. Still cleaning some things up, and still working on finding an iPad for Bryn, but hopefully we&#39;ll be back up to speed in a few days. In the meantime, you should probably be backing up your own computers, right?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Interesting People of San Cristobal de las Casas</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/the-interesting-people-of-san-cristobal-de-las-casas/img_0567/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2157&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-2157&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0567&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0567-e1353466003832.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There are many reasons I love cities like San Cristobal de las Casas. One major reason is the unique blend of people here. Sure, you can find interesting people anywhere, but some places are magnets. The tourists are interesting enough as it is. Lots of neo-hippies with their long dreads, baggy yoga pants, piercings, tattoos and sandals. Many of them busk with music or silly entertainment acts, or do the street-performer thing. But there are so many of them that, after awhile, they begin to represent a kind of normal. They cease to stand out. But there are others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was walking down the sidewalk and was passed by a young Mexican with his pet iguana. It was bright green and connected to a leash and riding on top of his head. That&#39;s not something you see every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that same day I passed the Templo Mexicano church near our apartment. In the plaza out front a gentleman was having a fight with a payphone booth, literally. Evidently it had insulted him. He hit it a few times, then picked up the handset and threatened the phone with it. He was yelling incoherently the whole time. He was also wearing nothing but his underwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-2156&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 20px;&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0595&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0595-e1353466038101.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today an interesting person visited the restaurant I was sitting here working in. He is the reason I finally got around to writing this post, which has otherwise been bouncing around in my head. He was wearing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straw western-style hat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunglasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red bandana tied around the neck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;six pens, all different colors, tucked into the front of his shirt, not in his shirt pockets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;green bandana wrapped around his left hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanging from his belt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 caps, one on each side -- both appeared new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one screwdriver, still attached to the price card from the store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional cell phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toenail clippers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB memory stick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large set of keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carved wooden horse, hanging from what may have been a decorative bridle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately he was carrying the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mesh shoulder bag/tote full of things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jacket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell Phone plugged in and charging -- and playing a radio station with a lot of static&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;digital camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;golf ball&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these items were hanging from large carabiners sturdy enough to support thousands of pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? Interesting, no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the time, early morning, daytime, night, sometimes all night long. There&#39;s always a story. This blogger went and dug out this local coming-of-age tale early one morning. Nice read!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Take a Little Trip with Me</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/take-a-little-trip-with-me/"/>
		<updated>2012-12-25T18:00:00-06:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So our new traveling friend from Greece, Loretta, wanted to go to Palenque for a couple of days. I had had a hankering to go there too. Well, let&#39;s just go! Glenn did not really want to go, so we did a girls trip and had a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: none;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8226840997/in/set-72157632125265398&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357146040227.6973&quot; class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8338/8226840997_351d1e54dd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a first-class bus for under $13 US each for the nearly seven-hour trip. The Mexican state of Chiapas is a gorgeous, lush place in the world with a lot of surprises along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: none;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8226839419/in/set-72157632125265398&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357146040210.8218&quot; class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8488/8226839419_31eca4277f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flew over the mountain valleys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: none;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8227883904/in/set-72157632125265398&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357146040163.159&quot; class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8227883904_f924aeeb83.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway, we had a brief stop in the town of Ocosingo, and we wandered into a bakery. Mexicans are serious about their celebratory cakes. The large round in the middle of the purple display was about two feet in diameter, and three walls were dedicated to similar creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way are numerous little chapels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever seen a &amp;quot;Mexican toll road&amp;quot;? Do not even think about refusing to stop! I guess, &amp;quot;If you&#39;re going to use this nice road through our town, you should pay something, no?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers and families travel by foot along the roadways which are squashed by encroaching jungle, battled by small teams of men with machetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived in the city of Palenque and got a collectivo to take us to our &amp;quot;hotel compound,&amp;quot; called El Jaguar, just outside the entrance to the Palenque ruins. We were treated to a walk into a jungle &lt;span style=&quot;-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469);&quot;&gt;setting &lt;/span&gt;(&amp;quot;We&#39;re in the jungle!!!) housing three or four hotels/hostels/cabanas/camp sites with a large restaurant and several outdoor bars. We chose a nice hotel, Margarita, settled into our private room with two double beds and a nice bathroom for about $10 US/day/person, and went to Don Mucho&#39;s for dinner and cocktails amid the calls of the howler monkeys and then the songs of the nightly entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pretty beetle is the size of a green grape! (We&#39;re in the jungle!!!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, life is good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked an all-day tour to two Mayan ruins sites for day two, Yaxchilan and Bonampak. We left at dawn and returned after dark, exhausted. Stay tuned for the wonders!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Musings on the Year in Review - Goodbye 2012</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/musings-on-the-year-in-review-goodbye-2012/"/>
		<updated>2013-01-02T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/musings-on-the-year-in-review-goodbye-2012/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2013/01/2012-In-Review.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Salsa with me!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read other bloggers&#39; posts on the year-end/year-beginning, I realize that I can&#39;t even begin to touch on the deep insights and useful instructions for New Years&#39; resolutions that many have written. And I&#39;m a little weary of reading them, so I fear you may be too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I will say that this first year (almost) away from the familiar, mundane, routine of home in the USA has been one of the best ever for me/us. It has been an amazing year of new insights, sights, sounds, tastes, musings, friends, cultures, understanding, misunderstanding, shock, outrage, comfort, discomfort, on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it worth leaving home, friends, family, job, paychecks, comfort and routine behind? YES! Though we often miss you greatly, our family and friends, the rest is just the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; we left behind to explore a different way of life and being to discover how other people in the world &amp;quot;be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life housesitting in Chapala was a fairly easy introduction to life in a foreign country. We spoke only enough Spanish to get by and had no idea how things worked in Mexico. There, there were enough English speakers and ex-pats that we could learn something of the culture and how normal life works. We learned how to shop in the markets and tiendas and large stores, how to get around, even how to never throw toilet paper in the toilet. We had a wonderful, friendly, helpful Mexican maid and gardener to practice our Spanish with and learn from. Then we ventured to San Cristobal de las Casas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to fall in with some local travelers and residents and make wonderful friends, and three or four days turned into six months. In a foreign place, you all learn from each other as life happens. As, one by one, our friends leave the area, we are saddened, but that is just the way the travel life is. Having friends all over the world, keeping in touch with the internet, is a wonderful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in one of the overall poorest (also one of the most beautiful) states in Mexico, Chiapas, there are many severe contrasts, and it is often unsettling. I have seen that literally dirt-poor, dirt floor villages of people are just as happy, if not more so, than big cities of money-people so busy running here and there under pressure. The Maya work hard for what little they have, little cinder block homes with dirt floors and yards and precious little inside, a few chickens, a little plot of corn and vegetables, the village fields and livestock, but they are seen in the evenings laughing and playing with their kids as the food cooks on a grill. Not so different, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They live in villages where they all prosper or suffer together. No one can afford to wall themselves off in selfishness, the &amp;quot;I have mine, you get your own&amp;quot; mentality, like we in the US do. In poverty in the city, of course, others are seen in abject misery too, with no help from the government to help them eat or get medicine, especially if they have no family. But in the villages it seems they prefer to live as their culture has for centuries, self-sufficient, only coming in to sell their wares so they can buy some staples and &amp;quot;luxuries.&amp;quot; They want their independence and autonomy to live as they see fit, not in a society that degrades them wants to dictate to them. They are poor, but they are a proud, industrious, and intelligent people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2013 comes into being, we have plans to leave Mexico behind and explore the tiny country of Belize for a while. I believe Belize is the first place we dreamed of retiring to. My, how plans change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meant for this to be a very short and sweet post, but that didn&#39;t happen either! So may all of you have a wonderful and prosperous 2013 and discover the things you seek! Salud!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Jungle Ancients:  Yaxchilan, Bonampak</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/jungle-ancients-yaxchilan-bonampak/"/>
		<updated>2013-01-04T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/jungle-ancients-yaxchilan-bonampak/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: none;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8256739844/in/set-72157632203613240&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357143784506.2773&quot; class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8219/8256739844_5cf956317e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We waited in the dark for our tour van, listening to the jungle awaken. Driving as the dawn breaks through the lush countryside was refreshing -- until we came upon a terrible rollover accident and we walked near, to be reminded of how fleeting life is. Thankfully, no one died here, and we were only delayed an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour provided breakfast at a little roadside tour restaurant, and we were all ready to chow down before continuing on. Arriving in the area we had to stop and pay a little to the Frontera to pass to the boats. The launch ride of 55 minutes was a gorgeous trip between the jungles of Mexico and Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8315851904/in/set-72157632355071205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357143784507.0945&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8211/8315851904_0aa9189697.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First sighting a tall ruin from the river, the rest of the exploration trek did not disappoint, and we were serenaded by howler monkeys in the high canopy. I find that ruins are best enjoyed in solitude or with a friend, not in crowds, so that I can contemplate and discover in my imagination as well as with my senses. Yaxchilan is large, and we only encountered a couple of other small tour groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8315938490/in/set-72157632355071205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357143784483.5657&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8211/8315938490_04ac6767c6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;371&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour guide did not speak much English, so Loretta and I just broke off and went on our own. The signage was in English, a Mayan dialect, and Spanish, so we got a bit of explanation as we went. This site is known for the elaborate carved stone lintels over the main doorways in major buildings and the carved stone stelae containing hieroglyphic texts that describe the city&#39;s history. (Be sure to check out the Mayan language in my pictures of the signs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8316293173/in/set-72157632355071205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357143784503.9365&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8495/8316293173_5e1017a0b8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8317329220/in/set-72157632355071205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357143784469.1367&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8355/8317329220_08b08dd9e3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 55 minute boat ride, and we got back on the bus to head for a much-anticipated lunch at a tour restaurant in the Frontera area before we headed to Bonampak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8317738922/in/set-72157632355071205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357143784514.7004&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8498/8317738922_8b0e6a845e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;331&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the delay at the accident scene, our visit to Bonampak was cut short so we did not get to climb to the higher temples. But the Temple of the Murals is the main attraction containing fabulous colorful frescos in three rooms. Wikipedia has a &lt;a title=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonampak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fascinating description&lt;/a&gt; of the site discovery and how a lucky accident preserved the murals for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8313029612/in/set-72157632351849764&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357143784441.086&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8213/8313029612_9e26266410.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8312047113/in/set-72157632351849764&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357143784498.9028&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8491/8312047113_192cbd8a68.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five o&#39;clock and the site closes down, so we hit the van for the very long ride back to Palenque looking forward to some good food and wine at Don Mucho&#39;s before passing out. At dinner we decided to take an extra day -- as indie travelers with no set itinerary we can do that! -- just to rest and enjoy our jungle hotel area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to over-touristy sites like Teotihuacan outside Mexico City, these are a breath of literal fresh air. There are no vendors yelling at you to buy, and there are few people compared to the size of the site, so you can have some peace in your jungle explorations. If you are ever in Chiapas, Palenque or San Cristobal areas, I highly recommend you take a tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the photos!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you come to Chiapas, Mexico, all the tour companies have trips to see waterfalls Misol Ha and Aguas Azul. The van dropped us off and said to &amp;quot;walk that way,&amp;quot; come back in an hour. Not sure what we would encounter, we walked. Yes, it was worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8318194354/in/set-72157632361522067&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357145420176.0032&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8318194354_f2de0f3ab8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loretta came prepared to experience the waters and swim, so she got the whole wet experience, taking the path up behind the falls. Very wet, windy area from the force of so much water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8318262572/in/set-72157632361522067&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357145420218.2844&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8318262572_9791f71810.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was back into the van for the drive to the Cascadas Aguas Azul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8317207841/in/set-72157632361522067&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357145420175.1624&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8317207841_ce486e8928.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that every brochure or poster for Chiapas has a picture of this gorgeous area. It had been raining quite a bit, so we were warned that the water might be more marron (brown) than azul (blue), but we wanted to see the cascades anyway. If it gets better than this, I don&#39;t know how!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8318357450/in/set-72157632361522067&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357145420233.9302&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8318357450_48242b560e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these waterfalls are run by the local indigenous groups, and they live here. Seems that each family has a booth to sell food or crafts. The walkway up to the top of Aguas Azul is long and jam-packed with things for sale, from tasty empanadas to clothing and jewelry to what claimed to be small meteorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8317253345/in/set-72157632361522067&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357145420189.6719&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8216/8317253345_4fca237e87.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people swim in the pools below the multiple waterfall areas, but the water is ice-cold, so be warned! Loretta was determined to get the most out of her trip and said, &amp;quot;cold, but you get used to it and it&#39;s nice.&amp;quot; I&#39;m not sure I believe her. While I relaxed and read a book, I soaked my feet in the water and they were cold the whole time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8317393903/in/set-72157632361522067&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357145420160.8523&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8218/8317393903_a807e6f375.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though both falls areas are popular tourist sites and have many vendors, they have managed a balance that is very enjoyable. I&#39;m very glad we decided to take this tour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the pictures from both our cameras!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: none;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8318476989/in/set-72157632374614284&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357837589276.013&quot; class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8077/8318476989_4793aa4d49.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final day tour began by walking out of our compound and catching a collectivo on the road into the park for 10 pesos. It stopped at the gate, we paid our modest entry fee, and rode on down to the drop-off point several minutes down the road. There we could hire a guide (we did not) to show us around, buy water, food, or souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: none;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8322314153/in/set-72157632374614284&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357837589256.488&quot; class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8073/8322314153_c88f84c98b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked on the nice, easy paths and climbed to the top of many incredible temples at this huge site. There are a lot of vendors here along the paths, but they don&#39;t holler at you or bother you -- unless you show interest in something as you walk by. Even with the number of tourists, it is still a fairly serene area. We even spotted several howler monkeys and spider monkeys in nearby jungle trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8319523502/in/set-72157632374614284&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357837589275.9465&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8359/8319523502_31d1874b56.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow the signage to see the cascades, you are rewarded with some nice peaceful waterfalls and the almost secret stairs up to the area that has not been cleaned of jungle growth. This was my favorite part, but Loretta opted to wait for me instead of venturing very far in. I wandered among the ruins like an adventurer on discovery. I even wandered down holes and came up on top of small buildings. I only encountered two or three other people in there, and it was fantastic! I sat and listened to the jungle sounds, howler monkeys in the distance, and imagined life back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/8322360633/in/set-72157632374614284&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;blogsy-1357837589213.5337&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8322360633_1d6d7280ca.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reluctantly, I emerged from the jungle to join my friend to continue our explorations. What a spectacular day! Enjoy the photos -- there are a bunch of them!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Talking Points!</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/talking-points/"/>
		<updated>2013-01-14T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/talking-points/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/10/spider.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;spider&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on the road, we meet a lot of new and interesting people from all over the world and have precious little time to get to know them, perhaps only the one day or evening to form a friendship. I am, and perhaps you are too, a little shy and often stumped for something to talk about. My culture is prone to be a bit distant and untrusting of new people and so I have always been hesitant to ask anything probing or personal and seem forward and nosy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have been searching, and my favorite advice for getting someone to like you is to be interested in them rather than talking about yourself (thanks to a post by &lt;a title=&quot;Married With Luggage&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marriedwithluggage.com/2012/12/12/be-interested-really-interested/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Married with Luggage&lt;/a&gt;). That takes the pressure off me to talk and makes the subject something interesting for both of us. I also found a great article from Ash Ambirge at The Middle Finger Project called &lt;a title=&quot;Your Life in Six Words&quot; href=&quot;https://www.themiddlefingerproject.org/your-life-in-6-words/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Your Life In Six Words&lt;/a&gt;. As part of a survey of her clients, she asked a series of questions. I am including them here, as well as a small sample of the inspiring answers left by her readers. (For the complete list of answers, read &lt;a title=&quot;Your Life in Six Words&quot; href=&quot;https://www.themiddlefingerproject.org/your-life-in-6-words/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ash&#39; article&lt;/a&gt;) I think these kinds of questions way trump &amp;quot;where are you from&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what do you do,&amp;quot; don&#39;t you? And they open up all kinds of possibilities for keeping the convo going beyond small talk about the weather and whether you like this city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first one is interesting and fun -- quick, six words for your life story! Kind of like a Haiku. What would yours be? Tell me in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In response to being asked to write a 6-word memoir summing up their lives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her beautiful mind kept her distant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took risks, found passion, followed dream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am still figuring shit out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took leap of faith, landed spectacularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soul searching sentimental crazypants. Dreams big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wind in her hair, world&#39;s her playground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In response to what advice they’d give their future children:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you feel safe somewhere, stretch your limits a bit, be a little wild. Then go somewhere new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love deeply. Laugh often. Find something you love to do. Be conscious. Give back. Send money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be brave, have heart, do what you love, fuck conventional wisdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In response to what one of their greatest unfulfilled dreams is:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tour the world singing jazz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a month-long sabbatical in Thailand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to financially support my mother. She was never a mother to me but it isn’t because she didn’t want to be. Her own tormented childhood led her to be eternally 9 years old &amp;amp; she still makes decisions as a child would. Her soul is (ultimately) kind and I want nothing more than to be able to give her a home but most importantly, the peace she’s never been able to give herself. Wow that was intense. But honest. I’m not a fan of phony small talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In response to being asked what they believe with all their heart:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world is a beautiful place and all people are basically good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mistakes are OK, but mediocrity isn’t. Failure to innovate is a death sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life’s too short to do work you hate and art can teach a soul how to sing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In response to a cause they’re really passionate about:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean water for 3rd world countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a safe, accepting and compassionate world for LGBT youth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animal cruelty and domestic violence. I REALLY wish those two things just didn’t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In response to something they’re most proud of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My three year old daughter. She is so intelligent and bright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-writing my uni’s plan to lower carbon emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My motorcycle adventures. Vancouver CA to the beaches of Cabo San Lucas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In response to something they wonder if:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My parents will ever move out of South Dakota and into civilization like I did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should have gotten married at 22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should just pack it in, move to somewhere with a beach that never gets cold, and just be a bartender and swim in the ocean for the rest of my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Year In Mexico</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/a-year-in-mexico/"/>
		<updated>2013-02-23T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/a-year-in-mexico/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2013/02/La-Pochota.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;La Pochota -- a kapok tree that has been here since the town was founded in the 16th century
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed San Cristobal de las Casas so much we ended up staying there for six months. But towards the end it began to feel like we had stayed too long. Eventually we began exploring our next move. When we discovered that some friends from Seattle were going to visit Belize in January, our plans were set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a few days in Playa del Carmen, then ventured on to Ambergris Caye, the northernmost island of Belize. We spent several days there, then another ten days shared with Rand and Angie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we had a decision to make -- what next? Our long-term plans were to go south, but we also knew that it would probably be awhile before we were this close to home again. We also wanted to get a second opinion on repair estimates for Bryn&#39;s MacBook Air. Glenn was also a bit tired after spending a week sick from a cold. On top of all that, Glenn wanted to reconnect with his daughter and see his grandkids for the first time. All of these factors meant that it was time to fly to Texas and see family again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;re back in Texas and reconnecting with a lot of people, trying to get things done. The MacBook repair did not cost us the $850 that the shop in Mexico wanted. As a matter of fact, it ended up costing us ZERO dollars! Our awesome friends Joyce and Steve have very generously lent us a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is taking us a bit to adjust to the different pace here. Oddly enough, we were actually out of the country 360 days! If we had been tracking this we would have waited an extra week just to make it even...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have lots of pictures and video to process and share, hopefully sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the longest you have been outside of your home country?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Back in Texas for a Bit</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So after we left Belize we flew back to Texas. We are here visiting friends and family for a bit, and trying to finish up some projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryn is doing a lot of homework in preparation for her TEFL certificate so that she can teach English somewhere. She is thinking that it will be nice to have a reason to get out of the casa, meet new people and make a little money at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn is still working on our first book, and is also working on a major site overhaul (you may have noticed some things changing around here) and thinks he may have come up with a new way of telling our stories that we hope you will enjoy. Here is a little sample for you from a recent weekend with some friends -- hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE: The &#39;new way&#39; of telling stories is a site that no longer exists. The link below now leads to a post right here on Vagabondians...]&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We won&#39;t be back in Texas for very long, but one thing we want to do a bit differently this visit is to see some sights, things we haven&#39;t seen before, in spite of living here for most of our lives. In other words,we&#39;re going to visit Texas like a tourist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2013/03/Home-Show-18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Massage&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We went along with our friends Steve and Joyce to see the home show in Fort Worth. It&#39;s sort of a tradition. Of course we don&#39;t own a home anymore, and all of our rentals are overseas, so we&#39;re not really the target audience. But Bryn really likes home shows. She got a free massage and a couple of TENS unit massages. She also got an application of some sort of miracle face cream, but only under one eye. It was kinda like a partial spa day. She sampled dips and listened to product spiels worthy of their own infomercial. Me, I just walked around taking pictures and sending them to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2013/03/Home-Show-29-Version-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Special Guest: Chewbacca&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The home show was at the Fort Worth Convention Center. There were two other groups using the facilities on the same weekend. One was a conference for some MLM product, &lt;button data-balloon=&quot;Evidently an MLM spin-off of NuSkin&quot; data-balloon-pos=&quot;up&quot;&gt;Lumi&lt;/button&gt;. They had high-dollar BMW&#39;s parked out front and were giving the attendees rides. I presume that these are some sort of incentive that you can theoretically attain if you sign up enough people underneath you. Also at the convention center was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/03/15/bigfoot-hunters-gather-in-fort-worth-this-weekend/&quot;&gt;BigFoot conference&lt;/a&gt;. Tempting, but we had a whisky tasting and distillery tour to attend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2013/03/Whiskey-Distillery-20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Whiskey Distillery 20&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Texas has a bourbon whiskey distillery! The first one in north Texas, one of very few outside ofKentucky. They describe themselves as &#39;artisan&#39; and we really enjoyed the tour. Currently the only product available is a blended whiskey. I&#39;m not a big fan of straight whiskey so I can&#39;t comment intelligently on the taste, which each tour participant was given. They are also barreling TONS of bourbon, which will be aged for two years. I think the first bottling will be in late 2013 or early 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all for now -- enjoy the pics!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Dear Apple: Goodbye!</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/dear-apple-goodbye/"/>
		<updated>2013-04-15T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/dear-apple-goodbye/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our first major technology shift was from Microsoft to Apple. We, like almost everyone else in the world, used computers mostly at work, and they were all Windows. Eventually Bryn got a Dell laptop, and years later I got a nice Windows Mobile cell phone from work. We were firmly in the Microsoft ecosphere, even though no one called it that at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our shift to Apple&#39;s ecosphere was slow, occurring in small increments. It started with music, as we migrated from the Diamond Rio to an iRiver and eventually to an iPod around 2005 or so. In early 2007 I bought a MacBook. In 2008 I bought an iPhone. The shift went exponential from there. We have now owned and resold so many Apple products that I&#39;ve completely lost count. Our workhorse computers during these first two years of travel were our MacBook Airs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we face another ecosphere shift. The end result may be much less focused on any one hardware or software manufacturer, but the shift will be quick and rather shocking. We are going to sell both MacBook Airs and both iPod Touch units. Our new technology will be two Google Nexus 4 phones running Android and two Acer C7 Chromebooks running both Chrome OS and Linux (Ubuntu). The timeframe for this shift?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximately 60 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In so many ways it seems that the story of our adult lives will be told as a constant progression from majority to minority, swimming against the flow, breaking taboos. Or, to put it another way, doing a lot of things that make people say things like &amp;quot;wtf is wrong with you?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What are you thinking?&amp;quot; Our technology shift is just the latest example. But why, you may ask? What is our motivation? A good question: allow me to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blame-it-on-mexico&quot;&gt;Blame it on Mexico &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#blame-it-on-mexico&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before we left the country for our year-long journey through Mexico a problem developed on my MacBook. I took it in to the Genius Bar at the local Apple store and they ended up having to send it off for repair. As our travel deadline approached, I noticed that one of the screws on the bottom was loose. I returned to the Genius bar and was told that it was stripped. They tried to tighten it but said it would require another shipment to the repair center. Unfortunately we were leaving in a couple of days, so I opted to wait, knowing that if the problem persisted I would be able to get it repaired under warranty. Mine was about to expire, and I intended to get the extended warranty — something we always did on our major Mac purchases. Except that I forgot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the screw loosened again and fell out. The case didn&#39;t seem to loosen or make any noise, so I decided to wait for any repair work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months later Bryn&#39;s MacBook Air developed a problem. The only way it would stay on is if you clicked on a popup window every 15 seconds or so, or if you held down the Option key. I tried all of my IT magic tricks, but nothing fixed it. And this is when we discovered that we had forgotten to purchase the extended warranty on BOTH of our Airs! I felt completely stupid. But when I looked my computer up on Apple&#39;s site it showed that it was, in fact, still on the original one-year warranty. This seemed strange, given the fact that it was almost two years old. I found out that when they had originally repaired it they had replaced the logic board. This is the guts of the computer, and replacing it evidently resets the warranty! I successfully extended the warranty for another two years and breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we took Bryn&#39;s Air in to the regional Apple authorized repair center in Tuxtla-Gutierrez and they gave us a diagnosis: the logic board. The repair estimate was $800US. We balked. A brand new Air w/ one-year warranty wasn&#39;t much more than that, and we wouldn&#39;t get more than $200 for the old Air for parts. It was a big financial setback. In the end we decided to wait until we got back to the States for repairs. In the meantime we bought an iPad w/ wireless keyboard as a temporary replacement. It didn&#39;t work out so well either, but lasted for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fix&quot;&gt;The Fix &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-fix&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got back to Texas we sold the iPad and took the Air to the Genius Bar. We utilized the flat rate repair service (only available state-side) which meant that the repair would cost no more than $280 (+ tax). But when the Air came back, one of the keys had been smashed down and was, in fact, broken. Back to the repair center it went! Fortunately a customer service supervisor felt bad about this and completely refunded the repair costs! So by waiting to come back to the U.S. we saved $800.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now by this point in the story you might be thinking that it sounds like Apple has great warranty and service, right? Yes, they do! But this decreases drastically once you leave the States. Repair times go up as well as costs, even under warranty. Depending on the country, you might not even find an authorized repair center for a few hundred miles. Based on our experiences, our observations and our thinking about where we would go next, we were getting a bit uneasy about taking off again carrying two expensive Macs, one without any warranty, into parts of the world where Macs were scarce. And that&#39;s when things got crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-change&quot;&gt;The Change &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-change&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I bought a Google Nexus 4. It will replace my iPod Touch and works with any carrier. In each country I can just purchase a SIM card and use it. In Mexico we used cheap basic phones, but they won&#39;t work in other countries. Second, I took my own Air back in to see if they could fix the screw thing. By now an additional screw had started loosening, and I discovered another one just flat missing! The repair would take the usual 5-7 days turnaround (although it usually happens much faster than that). I decided that this would be a good time to test out one of the new Chromebooks. I could buy it and then take it back after the Mac returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been touting them to people ever since I had seen them at Best Buy. The Acer C7 was only $199 and had a 320GB hard drive! I think they are the perfect home computers for the vast majority of people. So I bought one and brought it home on a Friday evening. By Monday morning I had given it a pretty thorough workout, and it seemed to do everything I would need it to do. Monday morning I took the Air in for shipping. Tuesday evening I got a contract to fix a busy WordPress site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;trial-by-fire&quot;&gt;Trial by Fire &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#trial-by-fire&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent most of Tuesday night and all of Wednesday working on this project. But eventually I hit a wall. I needed to do some things that were either very difficult or impossible to do with a plain Chromebook. Thursday morning I picked up my Air. So many parts had been replaced it was almost brand new! I fully intended to switch all of my work back over to the Mac, but I decided to install Linux on it and try to finish the job on the Chromebook. After all, it was doing so well that we had decided that if our MacBooks ever experienced a meltdown on the road we would just replace them with Chromebooks. Time for a thorough test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did, and in fact it worked rather flawlessly. Linux was a bit much for the installed 2GB of RAM, so I ordered an 8GB stick. But overall it worked well, and the additional software tools I installed were all open source and free. And then I had this crazy thought. I talked to Bryn about maybe selling my Mac &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; instead of at some future point. I told her that my Mac would never get more money on eBay than it would right now. She not only agreed, but she blew my mind when she said &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Why don&#39;t we sell both of them now?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; Zoiks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as soon as I finished my project and sent off the invoice, I had a new project. I had to figure out how to fully replace everything we were doing on the Macs with a new way of doing it on Linux. Photo editing, video editing, iTunes, blogging, playing Spanish tutorial DVD&#39;s made for Windows/OS X, computer backups. Everything. And if that wasn&#39;t enough, we decided to take some of the proceeds of the Mac sales and use it to get Bryn her very own Nexus 4 phone. We&#39;ll sell both of the iPod Touch units with the Macs. The change will be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits&quot;&gt;The Benefits &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-benefits&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several things we hope to achieve here. First, we want to minimize expenses. By selling the Macs now we minimize the cost of the switch. We also minimize the future cost of repairs and upgrades. The C7&#39;s utilize a standard notebook drive, available all over the world. And in a worst-case scenario we could just buy a new or used laptop for a couple hundred. We&#39;ve already priced these things on the ground in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we want to minimize repair or replacement turnaround time. By sticking with Acer, Samsung or other laptop vendors our parts supply will remain rather ubiquitous. In the big cities you can find plenty of Windows and even Apple vendors, but in smaller towns things drop off. So-called &#39;developing&#39; nations make do with cheap laptops and netbooks. Switching minimizes our downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and this is a minor point, but we reduce our theft risk. Small laptops and smartphones are &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; now. Macs are still viewed as a premium item and have a premium resale value to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and now we&#39;re into philosophy, I kinda like the whole concept of owning my own software and hardware. If I get the urge, I can hack my phone and do anything I want to it, including changing it from Android to full Linux! There is no one to tell me I can&#39;t install some app, for any reason. My laptop will be run by open source software, free and fully configurable. We will keep Google&#39;s Chrome OS intact, and Bryn will probably use it a lot, but we at least have a choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is the plan. I will probably write an update on this topic, especially after we get back outside of the U.S., but right now I have a lot of work to do to make all of this happen as smoothly as possible!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yep, we&#39;re still in Texas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Bryn made a trip to Michigan to see her sister. I&#39;m still in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryn has finished her TEFL certificate classes, and I am busy working on WordPress sites for various clients. We hope to be back on the road by the first week in June, probably headed for Nicaragua unless plans shift. Still have lots of changes to make to the site here and lots of photos and video yet to post. We&#39;ll get caught up on all that eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Destination: Nicaragua</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/destination-nicaragua/"/>
		<updated>2013-06-11T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/destination-nicaragua/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At long, LONG last we&#39;ve finally purchased tickets for our next destination: Nicaragua! We are so excited. We&#39;ll even get to hook up with our buddy &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnyvagabond.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jonny Vagabond&quot;&gt;Wes Nations&lt;/a&gt; again! Fun times will be had. Sober times, not so much...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2013/06/Nicaragua.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nicaragua&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have certainly enjoyed being able to see family and friends again, and even new family (sort of, long story) but living here is making us gain weight and spend too much money! We will miss my parents and brother and sister-in-law and my daughter and grandkids, and all of our friends, but we started getting antsy to get on the road again after about 90 days. But we did what we came to do, and now we&#39;re getting back to the travel. Here&#39;s a quick list of things we accomplished in addition to seeing people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bryn finished her TEFL certification and is now prepped to teach English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bryn&#39;s sister in California got to fly in and visit us for a few days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glenn discovered that people will actually pay for him to set up, maintain and repair web sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bryn got to fly to Michigan to visit her sister and family there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glenn got to attend a WordPress business and development conference in Austin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We sold our MacBooks and iPods and bought new, cheap laptops and Android smartphones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We both got Keen sandals!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we&#39;re off for the next phase. After a year in Mexico w/ short side-trips to Guatemala and Belize, it&#39;s time to dig in to Central America. We&#39;re skipping Honduras and El Salvador for various visa-related reasons and heading to Managua, Nicaragua. But not for long. The general consensus is that Managua isn&#39;t that fun, so we&#39;re planning on taking the first bus to Matagalpa and we&#39;ll travel around from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 17 days until departure!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>If You Can&#39;t Stand The Heat, Get Out of Texas</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/if-you-cant-stand-the-heat-get-out-of-texas/"/>
		<updated>2013-06-26T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/if-you-cant-stand-the-heat-get-out-of-texas/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we approach our final few days in Texas our home state has decided to give us a warm send-off. VERY warm. Today&#39;s high will reach 101-104. Friday it will hit 103-109, depending on which weather source you look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TXweather.png&quot; alt=&quot;TXweather&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to escape the heat, we&#39;ll be traveling to Central America. Yes, that&#39;s right, the place with the hot oceans and tropical jungles — much closer to the equator than Texas — and yet, also much cooler! The city we plan on visiting first is Matagalpa, Nicaragua. The elevation is only slightly above 2000 feet, and yet the temperature range for this time of year is typically 70-83. By going &lt;em&gt;south&lt;/em&gt; we will be losing 15-20 degrees! Strange, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.nicaragua-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Best-Matagalpa-Attractions-Waterfall-shadow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Waterfalls in Matagalpa
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key, of course, is altitude. We will be leaving the 604 ft. elevation of North Texas and going to the 2352 ft. elevation of central Nicaragua. It&#39;s the heart of coffee country, and we will arrive at the beginning of the rainy season. We&#39;re really looking forward to the cooler, wetter weather. I certainly hope Texas comes out of the drought soon — maybe next year?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Price of Free Tickets</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/the-price-of-free-tickets/"/>
		<updated>2013-06-29T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/the-price-of-free-tickets/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we travel, we seek adventure. But sometimes you should be careful what you ask for...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Family.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2491&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Family.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Family&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After saying goodbye to my parents and then my brother and his wife, we walked into the terminal at DFW Airport. The flight information we had indicated Gate E4, near where we were dropped off. Unfortunately we discovered that the Spirit Air ticket counter was actually on the other end of Terminal E, around Gate 27. So we rented a cart and took a walk. We detoured around a section under construction, exiting to the sidewalk at about Gate 21 and re-entering the building at Gate 30. We were missing a section! Eventually we found the Spirit counter down past Gate 32 and got our boarding passes. After we walked away we discovered that Bryn had passes for both legs, but I only had one. I returned to the counter and received my extra pass without much delay. I&#39;m glad I discovered the error when I did, otherwise I would have walked a 5K to fix it. We were surprised to discover that in spite of the fact that we did not reserve our seats online we were sitting next to each other, with a window seat for both legs. Bryn was happy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proceeded through security, where TSA agents took special interest in our bags. I suspect it was because of our one-way tickets, or our destination, or maybe the fact that I had a bag full of electronics gear. Two hard drives, a router, two sets of mini-speakers, headphones, a camera and a plastic bag with enough adapters and cables to assemble my own mini-Skynet. He dug through it, then indicated to me that he was going to swab it. Was he asking permission? What if I said no? LOL I assume he was looking for traces of explosives. Bryn&#39;s bag was delayed while they tried to figure out if a pair of scissors was legal. They were (yay?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then proceeded through a maze of construction tunnels and underground passageways and long people-movers until we got to our gate, E27. At the time I thought it was a new addition to the airport, but I could never figure out exactly where we were. I could see a major American Airlines hangar out the window, but I thought that was on the west side of the airport, and Terminal E is on the east side. I had to do some research on this, but as it turns out we were actually in the old Delta satellite terminal! When they moved their major hub to Atlanta they abandoned this building and it sat unused for eight years. It is now fully remodeled and all nine gates are exclusively for Spirit Air planes. It is very nice! There are sundries, books, a Starbucks, a Dickey&#39;s BBQ, a bar. There are also lots of comfy chairs out away from the gates, very handy if you have an extended layover or get stuck in a weather delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FB_IMG_13725412799713928.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2493&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FB_IMG_13725412799713928.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FB_IMG_13725412799713928&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FB_IMG_13725426329598574.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2494&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FB_IMG_13725426329598574.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FB_IMG_13725426329598574&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  As we sat at the gate it became evident that things were were not going to go smoothly. A flight to Denver was scheduled to depart at 4:55pm. Our Ft. Lauderdale was scheduled for 5:00pm. Both flights had a status of &#39;on time.&#39; After the Denver flight boarded, the truth appeared on the departure board -- 5:50PM. The gate attendants announced that we were overbooked and asked for volunteers to give up their seats in exchange for round trip tickets. I think someone took them up on the offer. We then boarded and finally got into the air around 6:15.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FB_IMG_13725479641120244.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-2495 alignleft&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FB_IMG_13725479641120244.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FB_IMG_13725479641120244&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  We arrived in Fort Lauderdale almost two hours late. But we still arrived at our departure gate almost an hour before the flight, standing room only in Terminal H. It felt like we were already in Nicaragua. Lots of people, many having chosen spots on the floor to sleep. About ten minutes later our gate crew started asking for volunteers to give up their seats. At first the only inducement mentioned was a meal voucher. No one bit. Eventually someone figured out that there were no other good &quot;next available flight&quot; options, so they upped the ante. A free night&#39;s lodging was added. Still no go. Then they offered a free round trip ticket. That seemed to do the trick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One spanish speaker beat me to the gate, asked some questions then walked off to consult with others. I asked about the details, then asked about the round trip ticket. I was trying to make sure both Bryn and I would get one. The gate attendant evidently thought I was trying to play hardball, and said &amp;quot;OK, two round-trip tickets for each of you.&amp;quot; SOLD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both filled out voucher forms. At some point we were told that this was conditional, that we still might be boarded on the flight, and we understood that. We were instructed to go back past security to the Spirit ticket counter and ask for a supervisor. We made the long walk, waited in line, then asked a customer service person for the supervisor and she took our boarding passes and vouchers into a back room. After about twenty minutes Xomorro (&#39;Shomorrow&#39;) came out and told us that there were problems. The only way to get us to Managua was to fly to Panama the next day on Copa Air out of Miami, then the day after that we would fly to Nicaragua. We told her that wasn&#39;t a problem at all! She was relieved, and a bit confused. We explained that we were traveling through Central and South America. Evidently not too many people do that. LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then explained the following things that we would get at no extra cost to us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One night at a Ft. Lauderdale hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One meal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cab to Miami International the next day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flight to Panama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A night at a Panama hotel for the 16-hr layover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flight to Managua, Nicaragua&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she went back into the back office to finalize things, we were excited! An adventure for sure, a good way to start the trip. Plus, an extra country stamped on our Passports. And then she came back out and ruined everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, the plane was, incredibly — 30 minutes after &#39;final&#39; boarding — still sitting at the gate, and the captain decided they had room and could wait for us. Xomorra was apologetic and seemed incredulous that they would do this. We had to go back through security, walk all the way down to the end of the terminal again. The gate attendant apologized profusely and took down our confirmation number and promised to give us one free round-trip each. Then we walked on to the plane full of tired, cranky people. And what a lovely and warm reception we got! It felt incredibly frustrating trying to explain all of what just happened with a facial expression. We did get to tell our story to a couple of people around us, plus a flight attendant. The rest of the plane were probably just staring daggers at us. I hope they at least think we&#39;re really rich or important people who pulled strings. Of course if that were true, we would have been sitting in the front of the plane, not the exit row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane finally left the gate about fifteen minutes later. The flight was originally scheduled to arrive in Nicaragua at 12:23AM. As we taxied to the terminal the pilot announced that it was 2:15. We cleared immigration after someone escorted Bryn to an ATM. We had forgotten about the entry fee ($10 US each). Customs was quick and painless. The taxi driver found the hostal without too much delay and we were in bed by 3:00am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it seemed like we would lie awake forever, our brains unable to shut down. The small window unit struggled to overcome the intense humidity. Eventually our brains were lulled to sleep by the ambient symphony of a light rain and air-conditioning throbs and window pane rattles and the occasional chirping of the geckos who watched over us. We slept the sleep of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

  In just a few minutes I have seen some fat brown birds, several great kiskadees, numerous doves, some beautiful dusky blue birds resembling blue budgies in pet stores but larger, and a gorgeous yellow and black bird with a bright orange hood.  And here we are in the middle of Managua, the bustling capitol of Nicaragua, though we are in a poorer barrio, not downtown.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;alignnone alignleft&quot; title=&quot;The malecon in Managua, Nicaragua&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5333/9240886396_92b01f58c2_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The malecon in Managua, Nicaragua&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Yeah, we should have known that when the guidebooks say it&#39;s not worth hanging in Managua, they are probably right. We walked around. We took a taxi to see the park at the volcano that overlooks the city but were thwarted. There was some kind of official visitation going on there, and they turned us away. We had the taxi take us to the Xolotlan malecon, where there was a fee to get in of about $.50 each. We walked around looking at big Lake Managua and had a decent lunch with beers for cheap at one of the nice cafes there. We saw a Sponge Bob and friend that were in need of a bath and a Barney walking around getting cordobas for posing with park visitors. The lake cruise boat came and went a couple of times. A nice diversion at the lake, but hardly worth coming all the way to Managua for if you&#39;re a tourist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 1034px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9240829598&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Our first Nicaraguan beer - The Malecon, Managua, Nicaragua&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7436/9240829598_b623bb2d36_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our first Nicaraguan beer - The Malecon, Managua, Nicaragua&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Our first Nicaraguan beer -- The Malecon, Managua, Nicaragua
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxi to the bus station the next morning went to the other end of Managua, and the scenery didn&#39;t change. A poor city with little to offer for tourism, though they seem to be working on that some. The bus ride out showed us somewhat of a downtown area with business people bustling around a little more modern buildings, but it was not what I would call big city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 778px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9238132185&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Sign in our bathroom, Casa de los Abuelos, Managua, Nicaragua&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7409/9238132185_61d6790e23_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sign in our bathroom, Casa de los Abuelos, Managua, Nicaragua&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to escape, we rose early after our second night in the fairly expensive ($35 US) humble hotel in Managua. The owner and staff were very nice and helpful, however, and I would definitely recommend it if you must go to Managua: Hostal Casa de los Abuelos. English spoken there!   Both bus stations in Managua are most definitely &amp;quot;third-world.&amp;quot; But the transportation is cheap and, um, efficient. If you don&#39;t get a (cramped) seat on the bus you want, you can still get on and ride on a stool in the aisle -- and you can bring your puppy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 810px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Puppy, on the bus to Matagalpa, Nicaragua
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  The owner of this puppy lives in Matagalpa and was extremely nice and helped us get a taxi to take us to a budget hostal. He sincerely wanted us to like his city. We even ran into him on the street later on and had a quick conversation before he went to his meeting. Matagalpa is a bustling little city, definitely more attractive than Managua, but it&#39;s no San Cristobal de las Casas &amp;#8212; we got so spoiled there! There are few tourists here with little to draw them, in the rainy season at least. I&#39;m not that eager to hike in the mud or tour coffee plantations. Call me wimpy. We are staying at the Hotel la Profe, which is an upgrade at less than half the price of Managua ($14US). We even have hot water and a fan on the ceiling! Also a nice little porch room to sit and compute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a title=&quot;The relaxing patio&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9342817313/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;The relaxing patio&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3734/9342817313_fb83a17943_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The relaxing patio&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Beautiful courtyard of la Profe&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9345602878/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Beautiful courtyard of la Profe&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7453/9345602878_ee6c5a4266_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beautiful courtyard of la Profe&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed for two nights, enjoyed a local coffee shop for cafe con leche and wifi. Then we headed back down out of the mountains into Granada. Apparently, we like more touristy places where we can meet more travelers!&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2013-08-09T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Warning: this post might get a bit graphic. You probably shouldn&#39;t read it while eating. You might not want to read it at all! You know how old people can&#39;t seem to have a conversation without over-sharing about their bodily functions? Yeah, that&#39;s how this is going to go. Alternate titles for this post that I considered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Enema Within&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Public Enema #1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Enema Territory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know Thy Enema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enema Agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see where this is going? OK, you&#39;ve been warned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many titles that I could have used for this. If I were a smart travel blogger I probably would have entitled it something like &amp;quot;Five Medical Emergency Lessons I Learned in Costa Rica.&amp;quot; Instead, I&#39;m going with a joke. I hope you appreciate the humor. &lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/simple-smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started out innocently enough. Bryn and I have generally been on a low-carb diet off and on for the last several years. We have removed most processed foods from regular consumption when possible. While we were in Mexico in 2012 we both lost weight, then promptly regained it when we revisited the states earlier this year. That should probably tell you something. After returning overseas to Nicaragua and Costa Rica we set out to re-lose our excess pounds and in the process we ran across a very interesting diet concept. The basic gist of it is that our bodies naturally guide our appetite based on traditional evolutionary patterns of &#39;feast and famine.&#39; It&#39;s only in the last 10-15,000 years or so that agriculture and animal husbandry smoothed out this process. In the last hundred years or so food has become global and seasons have almost been made obsolete. All foods, all the time, right on your local grocery store shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet our bodies are still trying to operate based on a feast or famine scenario. To the part of the brain controlling this, it seems like a lifelong feast has set in, and it keeps the dial turned up to &#39;more&#39; because surely that famine period will hit any day now. And yet it never does. So we eat too much, just a little every day. The diet in question attempts to turn the dial down by tricking the body. It attempts to game the system by sneaking calories in without any flavor so that the body doesn&#39;t associate flavor with those calories. This somehow tricks your body and reduces your appetite. I&#39;m not sure I understand all of the mechanisms involved, but it was enough encouragement for us to try it. Theoretically we could eat anything we wanted, but we still avoided highly-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are a few different ways to get calories into your body without strong flavors. The original method is to use sugar water, because for some reason the sweet taste doesn&#39;t trigger higher appetite. But it&#39;s a hassle, requires a lot of sugar, and Bryn is Type II diabetic on a small dose of Metformin. So sugar is out for her, and we like to do things together. The other option is to use extra light olive oil. In this case the calories all come from fat. After about a week we were both eating a lot less and losing weight. Unfortunately I missed a couple of warning signs and ended up in quite the predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where it gets a bit graphic. Again, you&#39;ve been warned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning signs that I missed were that my bowel movements became rather solid, more so than usual. On Wednesday morning I went ahead and took my normal four tablespoons of olive oil, but by the afternoon things came to a standstill. Lots of pressure, many attempts, no movement. I did a lot of googling for constipation solutions. In fact, I was well beyond constipation. I should have been googling &#39;fecal impaction.&#39; Instead, we went to the pharmacy and got some laxative pills. I took one that evening. I didn&#39;t sleep well, with a couple of additional attempts in the middle of the night. Thursday morning I took another pill and observed that I was also unable to urinate! I sent Bryn back to the pharmacy for suppositories. The first one lasted fifteen minutes, the second one stayed in place. Neither produced the desired results. I was approaching desperation! Bryn went on another errand and returned with small bottle and a dangerous looking nozzle attachment. It was an enema recommended by the pharmacist. It contained a small amount of sodium solution and 13.4 grams of Sorbitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2013/08/EnemaInstructions.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Behold, the Enema&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, sorbitol, the sweetener in items all over the grocery store. It&#39;s very prominent in low-carb products. I stopped eating anything containing sorbitol or any other sweetener ending in &#39;itol&#39; years ago because they caused me quite the intestinal distress, as in diarrhea. But diarrhea sounded pretty good right about now. So I put a towel on the shower floor and proceeded. I&#39;ll spare you at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the details, but things went generally well, especially for my first-ever self-administered enema. I intended to wait as close to fifteen minutes as I could before I had to rush to the toilet. I really did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to have to do a second enema, and I also didn&#39;t want to go to the clinic or hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lasted almost five, and somewhere between the laxative pills, the suppositories and the enema it was just enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end (ha!) it was fairly painful, but at least things were moving. It took about thirty minutes before I became confident that I was out of the danger zone and would not, in fact, die. And then I peed for the first time in a long time and that was also quite a relief! I was exhausted but way more excited about basic bodily functions than normal. I still am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the lessons? There ought to be several things learned here, it seems, but I&#39;m not sure what they all are yet. Here are my thoughts so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I&#39;m pretty sure that my body can not tolerate as much fat as it used to. I had my gallbladder removed almost a decade ago, and the bile that it produces is very important for the digestion of fat. It&#39;s even possible that my massive gallstones were originally caused by a &#39;slow liver&#39; which means that too much fat in my diet will cause all manner of digestion problems and irritation. Evidently this includes impaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if I ever get into this predicament again, I might be stupid. But just in case, if I do, I&#39;m just going straight for the enema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m just glad to be alive, and I&#39;m glad to be free of pain and pressure. I&#39;m also a bit gun-shy on making drastic changes to my diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was my week. How was yours?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the Mombacho Volcano erupted thousands of years ago, it threw huge rocks into Lake Nicaragua forming 365 islets, very large to very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/isletas.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2581&quot; src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/isletas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;isletas&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;168&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a community of about 1200 people living on them, mostly fishermen. Some islands have fabulous houses of the mega wealthy and others have humble cinder block simple dwellings, yet others are simply lush greenery and trees.  Many have hotels and cabanas and houses you can rent or buy.  For a price, a big price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9515374813/&quot; title=&quot;Ahhhh&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Ahhhh&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2808/9515374813_7488cd049b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ahhhh&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake Managua is huge, but usually calm, and we decided to take the tour boat all the way around the peninsula, touring through many of the islands.  It was a beautiful day, not too hot, and we took off to see what we would see.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Burn Rate</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/burn-rate/"/>
		<updated>2013-08-19T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/burn-rate/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Planning and goal-setting have never been our strong suits. The fact that we were able to get out of debt, sell all our stuff, get out of our house and save up a lot of money is almost miraculous given our track record. So I&#39;m going to cut myself some slack when it comes to timing. The fact is that when we quit our jobs we didn&#39;t have an income in place to pay for our travels. Up until very recently approximately 99% of our travel expenses have come out of our savings. It was a plan, but perhaps not the best plan. If we were a start-up business, or a rocket, you would say that our burn rate was unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative would have been to wait until either our savings were greater, or an income was in fact in place. But we had inertia, and bravado, and our jobs began to absolutely drive us crazy! So our &#39;Plan B&#39; was never firm, but it was enough for us. We always knew that if our passive/freelance income ideas never materialized we could do something a little more traditional. Teaching English, managing a guesthouse, working on a cruise ship -- all these ideas were in the back of our minds as options, and all of them would be better than going back to the States and getting a &#39;real&#39; J-O-B. We also knew that at some point we might become uncomfortable with how low our savings balance became. Did we really want to slide into our pension years with $0.00 left in the bank? Doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2013/08/burn-rate.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that day of discomfort has come. We have officially become uneasy about our bank account balance.  The chart above is from a spreadsheet we update to keep track of where we are. The red line is a worst-case scenario. It doesn&#39;t go to zero, but it is tracking our cash plus some other non-liquid assets. If we stay on that path, we&#39;d actually get to our official &#39;retirement&#39; date with almost nothing left. And as you can see by the green line, we&#39;re not on target. At this point our projection would be to crash and burn well before our target date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is good news and bad news to go along with this. The good news is that Glenn has finally discovered that people will actually pay decent money to get help with their web sites. In just the last few months we&#39;ve made more from that one source than all of our &#39;internet marketing&#39; attempts to date. The bad news is that we feel like we need to &#39;settle down&#39; somewhere for more than just a couple of months so that we can work on the business end of things, marketing stuff. Word of mouth is great, but we need to gain some consistency before we can continue with our plans of traveling through South America. Mexico spoiled us with their six-month easily renewable visas and low cost of living. Central America has, so far, proven to be quite expensive, especially Costa Rica! The other day we spent $16 on a medium-sized pizza with possibly the thinnest crust I&#39;ve ever seen. And as we move south the visas are all 90 days with unlikely renewals and increasing fees. So we have decided to back up a step or two. Specifically, we&#39;re going back to Mexico!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, we&#39;re going back to San Cristobal de las Casas. No other city has welcomed us like it did. We have friends and hangouts there, and the cost of living is so cheap! We plan on staying a minimum of six months, and quite possibly an entire year. While we are there we&#39;ll work on the business sites and marketing, and Bryn will probably start teaching English and putting her TEFL certificate to use. Glenn will also get down to work on the ebook projects. It&#39;s not a complete change of plans, more like a pit stop. Eventually we&#39;ll get back out on the road and hopefully we&#39;ll be able to travel in a more comfortable, sustainable style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we&#39;ll still be enjoying the wonderful culture of the state of Chiapas and traveling into the surrounding area. Chamula, Canyon de Sumidero, Arcotete, Tonina and Palenque will be visited. And when we need to reset our visa, we&#39;ll visit Lake Atitlan again and Antigua in nearby Guatemala. So now you know where to find us for the next year, and we&#39;ll be renting something with a guest room so you need to start planning your Mexican vacation now! It&#39;s cheap and it comes with a free tour guide.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Squinting in San Cristobal</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/squinting-san-cristobal/"/>
		<updated>2013-08-24T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/squinting-san-cristobal/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night was tamale night, picking up where we had left off with good friends and making new ones. &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnyvagabond.com/&quot; title=&quot;Johnny Vagabond&quot;&gt;Wes&lt;/a&gt; picked up tamales prepared by hand, wrapped in banana leaves, traditional for this area. Some had pork, the rest were a mystery since he didn&#39;t quite understand what the abuelita (little grandmother) told him. Some had molé sauce (that&#39;s &amp;quot;mo-lay,&amp;quot; not the little blind rodent) with shredded chicken, others remained unidentified. All had a prune in the center, and all were delicious! We washed them down with cheap wine and ghost stories while enjoying the cool breeze and wonderful view from Star&#39;s rooftop patio above her book store. A few of us wandered off around eleven, others stayed out till later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning there was a light fog, but it was all in my brain. As I stood in the Oxxo convenience store mindlessly preparing two cups of coffee I became aware of the sounds competing for my attention. In my left ear, the deep gonging emanating from the bells in the steeple of the nearby Cathedral of San Cristobal. In my right ear, the BeeGees sang out from a radio encouraging me to keep on Stayin&#39; Alive. I picked up a dona and paid for everything (37 pesos, about $2.85 US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Cathedral of San Cristobal&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9589231793/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Cathedral of San Cristobal&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2842/9589231793_aa290d9814_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathedral of San Cristobal&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside I stepped down from the raised sidewalk to the newly built pavestones at street level. When we left here in January the work crews were about halfway done with the renovation of the Zocalo, the main plaza in the downtown central historic district. Now their handiwork is complete and the square is surrounded by new large walking areas, restricting the vehicular traffic to one narrow lane and making it all much more pedestrian friendly. I have a feeling that the goal was to better connect the three main tourist walking streets where they intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;New sidewalks in San Cristobal&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9589218257/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;New sidewalks in San Cristobal&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/9589218257_86fd2f0797_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New sidewalks in San Cristobal&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look up at the Cathedral which dominates the square. I notice some architectural details that I had missed before. It is possible that the church has had some of its paint retouched. It&#39;s also possible that I just never noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Cathedral of San Cristobal&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9592022802/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Cathedral of San Cristobal&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2871/9592022802_fe166e3e78_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathedral of San Cristobal&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk the half block back to our hotel. The street is so familiar, like a long-lost friend to become reacquainted with. Last night it was loud and blurry, a river of people and sounds. Tribal drums from the neo-hippies mixed in with pounding bass from the dance clubs until you could feel it in your blood cells. Now the street is in need of some hair of the dog, or perhaps just a hot shower. Colorful stains are abundant on the pavestones, although it is unclear whether the source was food, drink, an earlier parade or possibly something from the stray dogs who help clean up leftovers in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9592038142/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2862/9592038142_b2c21dd813_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tzotzil woman working for the city is sweeping up with a large palm leaf, and eventually someone will empty the many trash receptacles mounted into the curbs. By the time we brave the daylight for breakfast, much of the evidence of last night&#39;s tourist excesses will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9592041202/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5470/9592041202_ae6a58ac77_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9592044806/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5340/9592044806_e530550442_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Real de Guadelupe&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve missed you San Cristobal. Buenos dias!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Mexican traditional celebration of the Day of the Dead is coming up! &lt;a title=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 1&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/10578783206/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 1&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2822/10578783206_48842d9ee9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 1&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Altars to the dearly departed are going up everywhere, homes, shops, public buildings. We are in one of our favorite restaurants this morning, and the altar here is being built and the entire floor is covered with pine needles. As the story goes, the spirits are invited back to celebrate and honor the lives they lead, and families and friends celebrate at home and in the cemeteries with laughing, eating, singing, even Mariachi bands. Offerings are placed on elaborate altars. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 2&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/10578696905/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 2&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7429/10578696905_f09850b728.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 2&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here are some things you might see displayed. Can you find them on this altar?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Candles &lt;/b&gt;-- Lit candles welcome the spirits back to their altars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marigolds &lt;/b&gt;-- symbolize death and the strong fragrance helps lead the dead back to their altars. Petals may be sprinkled on the floor around the altar or along a path from the front door to guide the spirit inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incense –&lt;/b&gt; often copal incense, the dried aromatic resin from a native Mexican tree, is said to guide the spirits back to their altars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Salt &lt;/b&gt;-- represents the continuance of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photo of the deceased &lt;/b&gt;-- A framed photo of the dead person(s) is placed in a prime spot on the altar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pan de muerto &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;-- &quot;bread of the dead,” is a symbol of the departed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sugar skulls &lt;/b&gt;-- symbolize death and the afterlife. They are given as gifts to the living during Day of the Dead and also placed as offerings on the altar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fresh fruit and vegetables &lt;/b&gt;-- whatever is available in season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other foods –&lt;/b&gt; usually altars include the dead person&#39;s favorite foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glass of Water &lt;/b&gt;-- thirsty souls may appreciate a glass of water after their long journey from the Beyond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toiletries –&lt;/b&gt; Spirits will want to freshen up so the altar might include a hairbrush, mirror, soap, a small towel, even their favorite cologne.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drinks &lt;/b&gt;-- the person&#39;s favorite drink is also laid out, possibly beer, tequila, whiskey, posh (the local moonshine here), a soda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Favorite small possessions &lt;/b&gt;-- Mementos and other things the person enjoyed in life are laid out, and often new things are bought. Only the best for the dearly departed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Images of saints &lt;/b&gt;-- or other people important to the dead person in life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Papel Picado&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt; -- cut pieces of colored paper are draped around the altar&#39;s edge or hung from above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catrina -- &lt;/b&gt;symbolizes the Mexican willingness to laugh at death.  Originally Catrina was an elegant or well-dressed woman, referring to rich people.  De la Torre said, &quot;Death brings this neutralizing force; everyone is equal in the end. Sometimes people have to be reminded.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ceramics and woven baskets &lt;/b&gt;-- are traditionally included in Day of the Dead altars. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The food from the altar is not actually consumed by the dead, but it is said that they take in the essence and nutrients of the food. The living eat the food afterwards, but it now “has no flavor or nutritional value.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;This altar is dedicated to the popular Che Guevara. I think he will be a very busy spirit, having to visit so many places!&lt;a title=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 3&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/10578992153/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 3&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7423/10578992153_fb5f4250c0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Day of the Dead altar 3&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

		<title>2013 -- A Brief Summary</title>

		<updated>2014-01-26T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/2013-a-brief-summary/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So 2013 was a pretty interesting year. We started in Mexico, visited Belize, spent five months back in Texas, visited Nicaragua, visited Costa Rica, then ended up right back in Mexico! We&#39;ve spent the last few weeks in sunny Merida. So far, that&#39;s the most countries we&#39;ve ever visited in one year. In 2014 we&#39;ll visit at least Mexico and Guatemala, not sure beyond that. So -- let&#39;s do this!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Big Bend National Park -- 1991</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s some old photos from one of our first big adventures. In 1991 we drove to Austin where Bryn took her state test for Court Reporting. Right after the test, we drove west to Big Bend National Park. We arrived at the Chisos Basin camp around two in the morning, having dodged wildlife for hours. We found no open spaces, so we grabbed an empty spot in the group camping area. We awoke to a frost-covered tent and a park ranger staring down at us through the tent mesh. He informed us that we needed to find another spot! We didn&#39;t argue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2011/04/2011-Texas-209.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bryn Going Away Party&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a week we had finished cleaning out our apartment and were &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/homeless-living-car/&quot; title=&quot;We Are Homeless and Living in our Car&quot;&gt;officially homeless&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2011/04/IMG_0366.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/bigger-tent-wheels/&quot; title=&quot;A Bigger Tent – on Wheels&quot;&gt;lived in a pop-up camper&lt;/a&gt; for several months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2011/05/Trailer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Trailer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/grand-canyon-north-rim/&quot; title=&quot;Grand Canyon – North Rim&quot;&gt;amazing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/grove-titans/&quot; title=&quot;Grove of Titans&quot;&gt;things &lt;/a&gt;all over &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/yellowstone/&quot; title=&quot;Yellowstone&quot;&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; America&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/glenn-2-0-2011-review/&quot; title=&quot;Glenn 2.0 – 2011 in Review&quot;&gt;family &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/seattle/&quot; title=&quot;Seattle&quot;&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2014/03/iowa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iowa&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/leavin-jet-plane/&quot; title=&quot;Well We’re Leavin’ on a Jet Plane…&quot;&gt;moved to Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/01/mexico.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mexico&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/death-and-beyond-in-guanajuato-mexico/&quot; title=&quot;Death and Beyond in Guanajuato, Mexico&quot;&gt;amazing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/jungle-ancients-yaxchilan-bonampak/&quot; title=&quot;Jungle Ancients:  Yaxchilan, Bonampak&quot;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; all over &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/happy-year-times-awastin/&quot; title=&quot;Happy New Year!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2012/07/MuseodeMumios.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MuseodeMumios&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we broke out of the cycle. We did the unexpected, the unusual. We changed the course of our lives.  Instead of doing what everyone else does and following our expected path, we took the next exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Escaped Normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three years now we have been traveling, seeing new places and meeting new people. We have been collecting memories and experiences. And we&#39;ve been sharing them with you, our friends and family and followers. Thanks for coming along for the ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, on to the next three...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four years ago -- we moved out of our 2,000 square foot home with the three-car garage and downsized to an apartment. On purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three years ago -- we moved out of the apartment and were officially homeless, living in a popup camper for six months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two years ago -- we were living in Chapala, Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, nothing significant happened. We were back in the USA visiting family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year, it&#39;s back! April Fool&#39;s day is, once again, a standout day on our calendar. Not because of where we are, or where we are going. Today is a big deal because we have been selected as the winners of the &lt;a title=&quot;oDesk Digital Nomad Contest Winners&quot; href=&quot;https://www.upwork.com/blog/2014/04/digital-nomad-winner-quit-sold-hit-road/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oDesk.com Digital Nomad contest&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s right -- we&#39;re officially Digital Nomads now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, we were already that. But we were selected from almost 2,000 entries! We won! And we get some amazing cool prizes! Here&#39;s what&#39;s included in our Digital Nomad Survival Kit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An official oDesk Digital Nomad t-shirt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A super-cool North Face Surge II backpack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An iPad Mini with an official custom oDesk Digital Nomad case!&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>The Organic Tianguis -- we finally made it!</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/organic-tianguis-finally/"/>
		<updated>2014-05-09T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/organic-tianguis-finally/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What the heck is a &amp;quot;tianguis&amp;quot;? you might ask.  Well, I believe it&#39;s loosely translated as a flea market. Back in Chapala, Jalisco, MX, they had the weekly tianguis, and you could buy almost anything there. Blocks of temporary stalls lining both sides of the street, everything from shoes to clothing to jewelry to toys; live farm animals and all kinds of fresh produce; stalls where savory food was prepared before your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Ground stall at the market&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8319/8003360376_a51034ffe8_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ground stall at the market&quot; width=&quot;251&quot; height=&quot;188&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Live chickens&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8033/8003358317_4dca166e5c_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Live chickens&quot; width=&quot;253&quot; height=&quot;189&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Lots of fresh local fruit&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8446/8003355331_6ea952137f_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lots of fresh local fruit&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;192&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in San Cristobal, Chiapas, MX, they have a huge market selling all kinds of things daily. The stalls are set up each morning early with a dazzling array of items. It covers several blocks, including permanent buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Organic market 1&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/13966800330_9c98e6a407_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Organic market 1&quot; width=&quot;380&quot; height=&quot;285&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Organic market 2&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7437/14153460275_bc4a63b8c5_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Organic market 2&quot; width=&quot;378&quot; height=&quot;283&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today we finally made it to the organic tianguis housed twice weekly in a building near one of the walking streets. It&#39;s small, but the local farmers and sellers grow and use all organic methods. No chemical pesticides, hormones, antibiotics in their wares. The veggies and greens are just beautiful and full, not the wilty, buggy stuff you often find at the big market or the dried-out, old produce you often find at the big grocery stores. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are some beautiful offerings at the big market too, just not all are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this little market, people make fresh breads, salsas, sauces, pizzas, cheeses, desserts, local honey and other offerings. Beautiful fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/14153319285/&quot; title=&quot;Organic veg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Organic veg&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/14153319285_3e298b3d25_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Organic veg&quot; width=&quot;246&quot; height=&quot;185&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Organic fruits&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5536/14153447625_48a85bc93a_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Organic fruits&quot; width=&quot;248&quot; height=&quot;186&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Organic market 3&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5274/14130274046_7cfb7fc782_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Organic market 3&quot; width=&quot;249&quot; height=&quot;187&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a table with freshly butchered rabbit and chicken, homemade sausages and other meats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Fresh meat&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/13966659468_fece8eb6de_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fresh meat&quot; width=&quot;531&quot; height=&quot;398&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we were after k&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;ombucha, which is a lightly effervescent fermented drink (not alcoholic) that is loaded with probiotics. The lady had jamaica (hibiscus) and lemon-hierbabuena (lemon-mint) flavors. Mmmm, so nice and healthful! We also bought a nice loaf of homemade bread from her, and a hunk of soft, flavored homemade cheese from another lady that hails from Argentina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/13968097090/&quot; title=&quot;Kombucha&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; title=&quot;Kombucha&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2903/13968097090_59647d602d_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kombucha&quot; width=&quot;527&quot; height=&quot;395&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will definitely be back regularly to purchase produce and chicken and other tasty treats -- and definitely more kombucha!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Saripiqui River and Canopy Tour</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/saripiqui-river-canopy-tour/"/>
		<updated>2014-06-10T19:00:00-05:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a last-gasp effort to see something of the beautiful country of Costa Rica, and with a deal on a tour from a friend, I ventured out alone while Glenn continued to recover from his minor back injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Nice orchid&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497546273/&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Nice orchid&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/9497546273_a2b8787d9a_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nice orchid&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;While being driven out of town alone in a large tour van, via my splotchy Spanish, I finally understood he was taking me to meet another van.  Eventually by the side of the road there was a driver named Carlos and a personable, knowledgeable English/Spanish guide, also named Carlos, and a nice Brazilian couple, and we ventured forth.  Conversation went pretty well between Portuguese, Spanish, and English, and the drive was beautiful as Carlos pointed out the different ecological zones, rain forest, cloud forest, and over the continental divide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497413937/&quot; title=&quot;Canopy tour and lunch grounds&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Canopy tour and lunch grounds&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7425/9497413937_a3104f4e48_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Canopy tour and lunch grounds&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at a remote property, we went through a gate, down a path, and arrived under a big palapa where there was fresh fruit laid out for us, the sweetest papaya I&#39;ve ever had, succulent pineapple, and some fresh bananas.  There were four very cute bats hanging out above, watching us devour our treats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497550527/&quot; title=&quot;Firefly Forest Proboscis Bats hanging from palapa ovrhead&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Firefly Forest Proboscis Bats hanging from palapa ovrhead&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3788/9497550527_12969dbc74_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firefly Forest Proboscis Bats hanging from palapa ovrhead&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just down the path we met our tour boat, and -- after some tinkering with the engine -- off we went down the Sarapiqui River, our guide pointing out the wildlife while the driver brought us right in close for pictures.  Lizards and monkeys and crocodiles, oh my!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9500310444/&quot; title=&quot;Granddaddy croc&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Granddaddy croc&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5445/9500310444_a2451417dc_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Granddaddy croc&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pleasant hour later, we climbed the stairs into the jungle for ziplining and lunch.  I was the only taker for the canopy tour, so the Brazilians relaxed and photographed birds while I was geared and helmeted up, led to my horse, and away we went, two walking along the road and three riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497402681/&quot; title=&quot;Me and my horse to the ziplines&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Me and my horse to the ziplines&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7387/9497402681_783dbaca3e_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me and my horse to the ziplines&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 10-15 minutes we arrived at the beginning of the zip course.  I looked up the ladder and, holy crap!  About 50 feet up that ladder was the first platform. Boy, did my lack of Jazzercizing show!  &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;  I must have climbed halfway up the Empire State Building between all the high ladders at each platform.  At the end I didn&#39;t want it to be the last, but I really couldn&#39;t have survived many more ladders!  My two hunky-boy guides were a lot of fun and totally professional, much attention paid to safety on the well-maintained zip course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497405195/&quot; title=&quot;Made it up the ladder&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Made it up the ladder&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3759/9497405195_a30a980fe3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Made it up the ladder&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was strongly suggested that canopy tour participants not take their cameras, because the guides would take pictures, so I have none, except a couple I sneaked of the slide show afterwards.  I found it really strange that nobody actually hit me up to buy the pictures.  Such a difference from other countries where there would have been a hard sell. The only animals I saw in the jungle were a pretty orange poison dart frog along the trail and a few battalions of ginormous mosquitoes.  Amazingly, they didn&#39;t seem to be too hungry; just a couple toothy vampires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9500267584/&quot; title=&quot;Blue jeans poison dart frog&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Blue jeans poison dart frog&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5496/9500267584_7ece833a8f_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blue jeans poison dart frog&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was typical Costa Rican fare: beans and rice/rice and beans, some pieces of grilled chicken, some salad-y stuff, and a very sweet fruit drink.  Our guide then led us down to a small building where they housed several local species of snakes, from a couple of large boas to some highly venomous vipers, the dreaded fer-de-lance and a pretty yellow eyelash viper. We were told that they only keep them for a little while and then release them as they catch new ones.  The collection was smaller than usual at this time. Next door was another greenhouse building where lots of blue jeans poison dart frogs lived. So cute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9500188100/&quot; title=&quot;DSCN1151&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;DSCN1151&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7325/9500188100_3f09621c32_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DSCN1151&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got back on the road and experienced an absolute downpour for about half the drive back, up from the river into the cloud forest and back down into drenched San Jose. Enjoy the slide show!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we almost made it. Unfortunately we screwed up and didn&#39;t think things through and ended up returning from Mexico to the U.S. after only 360 days abroad. We missed that landmark by five days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not this year! We left the Ft. Lauderdale airport in Florida on June 30, 2013 and haven&#39;t stepped foot on U.S. soil ever since. Today actually marks day 367, and it will be another month before we return to Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, this might actually be the last time we&#39;re outside the U.S. for this long, at least for the next few years. In November we&#39;ll return to Mexico and set up shop back over on the West side, on Lake Chapala, south of Guadalajara. That means that, when it comes time to &#39;reset&#39; our tourist visas, we can&#39;t just jump in a van and cross the border by lunchtime. We&#39;ll have to fly, which opens up some new interesting opportunities to see family and for Glenn to maybe take in some extra work-related conferences. Our time outside of the U.S. will shrink to six-month windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of our lives, we never imagined spending this much time away from our home country. I was 46 before I ever (briefly) left the United States. A few short years later and I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; in a foreign country and have been outside the U.S. for fourteen of the last eighteen months! We&#39;re doing pretty much what we dreamed we would do when all of these crazy plans began to form in our heads back in late 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Vagabondians Have Landed</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/vagabondians-landed/"/>
		<updated>2014-11-21T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/vagabondians-landed/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After downsizing in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, packing up our necessities for storage at our friend Tere&#39;s house in Chapala while we spent three months back home in Texas, we have come back to roost in a village beside the biggest lake in Mexico, Lake Chapala. We have a quaint little apartment with beautiful views of the calm lake and surrounding mountains. Bryn&#39;s wishes for a rooftop and a garden were granted by the Househunting Fairy Godmother, so all is well. We even have pretty darn good birdwatching from our windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village of Ajijic (Ah-hee-HEE) is home to thousands of people from America, Canada, and any European country you can name, and probably some you can&#39;t. We really want to beef up our Spanish, but so much English is spoken here, that it makes motivation to insist on Spanish more difficult. We try to deal with Mexican vegetable stands and stores instead of Walmart whenever we can and try to be understood in our still-sad Spanglish. The next class at the Lake Chapala Society starts in December or January, and we plan to be there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4024&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountains are huge and rugged, the flowers are a riot of color everywhere, the lake is gorgeous, sunrise and sunsets spectacular. Ajijic is home to artists of all ilks, so the creativity is astounding: murals on outer walls, art shops, jewelry makers, sculpture, photography, gardens, gourmet food. Every turn on a walk around town brings a new surprise to delight the senses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lake Chapala Society is a huge organization started back in the &#39;50s as a way to help foreign residents and give back to the community. There is a group for about every activity you can imagine as well as many charitable activities, so we plan to be busy here. At least Bryn plans to be busy while poor Glenn works hard with his web development business, supporting our vagabond lifestyle. Lots to do after hours together too, like sunset walks along the lake on the malecon, tons of music venues, copious numbers of restaurants and coffee on the plaza. And the weather is pretty perfect most of the time, so staying cooped up at home should not be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hola, Mexico — hola Ajijic!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Legend of Johnny Vagabond</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/legend-johnny-vagabond/"/>
		<updated>2014-11-26T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/legend-johnny-vagabond/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We first met &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnyvagabond.com/&quot; title=&quot;Johnny Vagabond&quot;&gt;Wes Nations&lt;/a&gt; our second night in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifepart2.com/&quot;&gt;Jon Look&lt;/a&gt; introduced us. We met at a wine bar, of course. Wes had a couple of years head-start on both Jon and ourselves, and had spent his first few years in Southeast Asia. This means he had more stories to tell, and he lived to tell stories. I&#39;m pretty sure his stories were a big part of why Jon is now in Southeast Asia himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon and Wes had just returned from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnyvagabond.com/crazy-stories/lightning-sea-turtles/&quot;&gt;crazy trip&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifepart2.com/sea-turtles-lightning-storms-and-life/&quot;&gt;Pacific coast of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chiapas. Between that trip and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifepart2.com/street-food-rat-soup/&quot;&gt;previous one&lt;/a&gt;, in which they had perused the market of a small, nearby town&lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnyvagabond.com/travel-tips/in-search-of-rat-soup/&quot;&gt; looking for rat soup&lt;/a&gt;, they had wonderful stories to tell. And by wonderful I don&#39;t mean stories of hanging out at the pool of a pricey resort. I mean &#39;real&#39; stories. Stories that involve strange food, foreign languages, storms, getting lost, and maybe the occasional hallucination. Fear. Adventure. They had everything we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4039&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2014/11/That-Wes-is-SO-Gonzo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2014/11/That-Wes-is-SO-Gonzo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;That Wes is SO Gonzo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    That Wes is SO Gonzo
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those first several months in Chiapas I often ran into Wes on one of the main walking streets of San Cristobal, mostly coffee shops or restaurants, usually a sidewalk table. I can still picture him sitting in the sun, sipping a glass of white wine, tapping away on his iPad keyboard. I referred to his usual spot at the Rincon del Toro as the Wes Nations Chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also remember the night we were sitting in the wine bar and after wine and some tequila shots, Wes was unusually quiet. He said that &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnyvagabond.com/crazy-stories/tribute-to-a-friend-long-gone/&quot;&gt;a friend of his from back home in Texas had passed away&lt;/a&gt;, and it was tearing him up. I tried, weakly, to comfort him as best I could as he sat and quietly sobbed at the table. It was one of those moments when you get to strip away the bravado and the public appearance we all try to keep up. The shields were down, and his humanity shone through. Its times like this that forge bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wes was fairly well-known in travel blogger circles. One time Bryn and I were having lunch in our favorite restaurant, TierrADentro, and were approached by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://discoveringice.com/&quot;&gt;cute young couple.&lt;/a&gt; They said hi, and then asked me, &amp;quot;Are you Johnny Vagabond?&amp;quot; I got a big laugh out of this. Johnny Vagabond was Wes&#39; alter ego and the name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnyvagabond.com/&quot;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m pretty sure I told them that, no, I&#39;m much younger and more handsome than him, but that I could connect them. So we exchanged information and made plans to meet up later that afternoon — at the wine bar, of course. When I relayed this story to Wes, I expressed much faux indignation that anyone would mistake me for him. And it wasn&#39;t the first time it had happened! Andre and Stephanie did get to meet him that day, and they were two of hundreds of people around the world who were inspired by his writing. But I got a story and a running inside joke out of it, and that made it special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite stories that Wes shared was about a time when he was in Vietnam, I believe. He was working at an outdoor table and a young girl came up to him selling some things. He actually needed something, although I don&#39;t remember what now, but she didn&#39;t have it. Later, a young boy came by, and he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have what Wes needed, so he bought one from him. A little while later, the first girl came back by and saw that Wes had bought something from someone else and not her, and became incensed! No explanation would suffice to assuage her anger and disappointment. So she sat down on the curb near his table, and for an hour or so she would look back over her shoulder every few minutes, glare at him, and say &amp;quot;Fuck you!&amp;quot; in fairly good English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chuckle every time I think about that scene. Except now the laughter quickly turns to tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4042&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Wes and Jon moved on from Mexico and have traveled Central America and Southeast Asia while Bryn and I have remained somewhere between Guadalajara and Costa Rica. Our days of traveling far and wide are still in the future, scheduled to pick up in late 2017. We just missed hooking up with Wes in the summer of 2013 in Costa Rica, but finally reunited in San Cristobal in the fall of last year. We had a couple of different &#39;tamale night&#39; dinners with him and other friends. And we hung out at the wine bar. And we swapped tales. And Wes had a visitor -- Jill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked Jill. Wes seemed to be anticipating a nice visit from a friend, but evidently some old flame flickered and they spent most of a week more as lovers than friends. I can&#39;t begin to tell you how happy this made me — not because I think Wes was lonely, but because he seemed genuinely happy with her, and what else can you want for a friend other than happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year Jill flew to Thailand and caught up with Wes, and on January 4 of this year he announced that they were engaged! Well wishes and hundreds of likes and comments flooded his Facebook page. It seemed to be a happy portend, but the on-again, off-again nature of their relationship seemed to preclude a happy ending. Star-crossed lovers, as it were, never quite able to work out the details. He was traveling, she was stuck at a job in San Francisco. The last I heard from him, it was more off than on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this last year Wes caught a nasty virus and also had a bad reaction to some antibiotics which made him hallucinate. And at some point, he came down with a problem which eluded diagnosis for too long. In the end, an antibiotic-resistant infection lodged in his pancreas. He was offline for most of this time, in and out of hospitals, his blog uncharacteristically quiet except for an occasional post or Facebook comment. Hints of an extended hospital stay hit his Facebook page a few months ago, and many inquired for details but the information was scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, he was gone. A mutual friend broke the bad news, and Wes&#39; Facebook page is now being flooded with remembrances and condolences. And stories. Lots of stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, I am both sad and angry at this news. I&#39;m angry that good people sometimes leave our lives early. And I&#39;m incredibly sad that this short list now includes Wes. I didn&#39;t know him that long, and I can&#39;t say that we were &#39;best&#39; friends. But he made me laugh and that&#39;s something I truly value in a person. And when I think about it, he&#39;s probably the closest I&#39;ve come to a true friend in these last several years. I guess I&#39;m a bit of a homebody, a nerd, and I don&#39;t have that many people whom I consider &#39;close&#39; outside of family. Don&#39;t ask me why, because I&#39;m really not sure what makes me that way. But Wes definitely got in there, into that inner circle, and his passing has saddened me greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4040&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2014/11/WesAndDrunkGlenn.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/2014/11/WesAndDrunkGlenn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wes and drunk Glenn&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Wes and drunk Glenn
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one thing which slightly takes the edge off of my sadness, and that is that Wes truly took to heart the idea that life is, in fact, short. Whether you are forced to leave early, or whether you pass the century mark like my great aunt Cynthia, this is it. One life. One brief time on this pale blue dot floating through the universe. And just like us, Wes decided that he didn&#39;t want to spend all of his brief time here spending fifty weeks a year at a job and two weeks a year on vacation. He didn&#39;t want to spend 95% of his life in one place. He yearned to travel to &amp;quot;... see as much of it as I can while it’s still here.&amp;quot; And he did. And that&#39;s comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because in the end, there are no guarantees. But in spite of that fact, which we all &#39;know&#39; in our minds, most of us act like there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; guarantees, like we have all the time in the world. And while it would surely be crazy to live in constant fear of the future, isn&#39;t it just as crazy to live in blissful ignorance? So do me a favor, and honor Wes&#39; life and passing with a little introspection. If there is something you should do, or that you want to do, just stop right now and figure out how to make it happen. Maybe it&#39;s travel, maybe it&#39;s volunteer work, maybe it&#39;s just spending more time with loved ones. But figure out how to do it now, not later, because later may never come, and all stories end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; story ends, will it be one that others want to share? Will it inspire others to do likewise? If so, then your story will live on in the hearts and minds of others, and that makes you immortal. Wes was an inspiration, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a teller of stories, and that makes &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; immortal. His deeds and his words can reverberate down through time. I&#39;m gutted that I will never again see him face to face, but I&#39;m going to tell his stories, and our stories, again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that I&#39;ll be telling others about him when I&#39;m old and my travel days are over. I can almost picture it now, sitting around a table at some hole-in-the-wall dive bar in some foreign country with a bunch of backpackers trying to one-up each other with travel tales. I&#39;ll wait my turn, then I&#39;ll say &amp;quot;Cool story, bro, but that ain&#39;t shit. Let me tell you about the legend of Johnny Vagabond.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>An update</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/an-update/"/>
		<updated>2015-07-03T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/an-update/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This will be brief, but I feel like I have to post &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; due to the long delay between articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, our apologies for not having more to say. To be honest, last year we shifted from active traveling to more of an expat lifestyle. Still, there were plenty of past travel events to write about and catch up on, and we are working on those but they aren’t up yet. Coming soon, promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we have discovered that Bryn simply doesn’t enjoy writing. The entire process is a lot more work than enjoyment for her, which means that keeping up blog posts is Glenn’s job. And Glenn used to do this on a fairly regular basis, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, Glenn has been extremely busy. He has worked 40-50 hours a week on web development for the last 18 months. The money was ok, and it helped pay the bills, but it left little time or energy for our own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and finally, big changes are afoot! Glenn and Bryn have decided to go back to the States and finish out Glenn’s pension vesting. He’ll still be working 40 hours a week, but when he retires he will get a decent amount of money every month, long after he stops working. Going back to a ‘real’ job isn’t what we had intended, but thirty years from now it’s very likely that we will appreciate the extra income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s the news here. Glenn is working on a revamp of the site using a new photo storage service, and we fully intend to catch up on all the trips we’ve taken, going back to the early 90’s! Stay tuned, and thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hitting Pause on Travel</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/hitting-pause-on-travel/"/>
		<updated>2015-11-26T18:00:00-06:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/hitting-pause-on-travel/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we last spoke with Glenn and Bryn...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, as much as I would love to write this in the third person, I probably shouldn&#39;t. But yes, it&#39;s been awhile. However, things have been pretty busy behind the scenes and in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our last update we mentioned that Glenn was going back to the States to finish out his retirement pension vesting. This is now well underway as we are now working and living in Austin, Texas. Glenn is now the sole help desk person for a governmental entity, supporting around 120 or so employees. He has already attended at least one &#39;service awards&#39; meeting where his fellow co-workers were receiving recognition for 25-30 years of service! That is one thing that we know we&#39;ll never receive, and we&#39;re fine with that. At some point in the next 3-5 years we will have fully vested pensions and replenished savings and will likely, finally retire -- for real. It will still be &#39;early&#39;, compared to most people, just not as early as we had originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In analyzing where we have ended up compared to where we intended to be by now, what we basically did was a combination of mini-retirement and self-employment. In retrospect, we would have been just fine if we had waited two years and taken off in 2013 for our nation-wide camping trip and then left for Mexico in 2014. We&#39;d still be south of the border and have plenty of money left in the bank. But hindsight is always 20/20. While we regret having to go back to &#39;work&#39; after having lived rather foot-loose and fancy-free for the last four years, we wouldn&#39;t exchange any of the wonderful memories and friends we&#39;ve already made. Looking back, we know we jumped the gun a bit, but we regret nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve already reunited with some of our friends from Mexico who are temporarily living in Austin, and we keep up with everyone else online. We are enjoying the city while we are here, and Glenn&#39;s job is pretty good so far. We meet up with other Spanish speakers regularly to practice. Family is close as well, and we&#39;re seeing them as much as possible while we can. We also celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of family, it&#39;s about time for the second day of Thanksgiving get-together meals. Bryn has a huge turkey and all the &#39;fixings&#39; in the kitchen and we&#39;ll eat within the hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re still working on image and video updates, as well as reworking many trip reports to more of a true travel essay format. The end result should be a much more enjoyable and readable site. We&#39;ll let you know when there is something more to see. Thank you very much for reading, and we look forward to giving you many more things to see, hear and read in the years to come. In the meantime, we hope you all have a wonderful holiday season!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Retired!</title>
		<link href="https://vagabondians.com/retired/"/>
		<updated>2019-05-07T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://vagabondians.com/retired/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, this is old news for those of you who are connected with us on social media, but in finally catching up on the blog, let&#39;s make it official. Glenn finished a two-year stint in Austin in 2017. By the end of August we were back in Mexico as officially retired people, and by October we were officially pensioners. Pensionados, or as they say in Mexico, Jubilados. Yes, we are quite jubilant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/justchillin.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Back at our home on the lake&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We originally moved back to Jalisco to enjoy the climate and our friends, and to an extent we did both. But there is a reason someone came up with the saying &amp;quot;You can&#39;t go home again.&amp;quot; Actually, that someone was Thomas Wolfe who wrote &lt;button data-balloon=&quot;Yes, titled You Can&#39;t Go Home Again&quot; data-balloon-pos=&quot;up&quot;&gt;the book&lt;/button&gt;. Over the years the phrase has come to be associated with the larger concept of change. And Lake Chapala has changed a lot. Shortly after we returned some close friends moved back to the States and our favorite restaurant/bar closed down. Also, we were vegan which presented a whole new set of problems. But we found places to eat and lots of new friends, and after a couple of false starts we ended up in a nice place with a great view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vagabondians.com/img/pizzapenthouse.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Pizza penthouse&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet the area seemed different. The gringo presence was growing larger by the day, it seemed, and the &#39;off-season&#39; when the snowbirds all went back to Canada for the summer didn&#39;t materialize. The American and Canadian population is now somewhere between 10-20,000 and mostly stays high year-round. This has resulted in constant traffic jams and and escalating rents. In the end, not only did our favorite Spanish teacher move back to Guadalajara but our landlord scheduled renovation after which our studio apartment would rent for almost $800US per month. Ajijic is trying to compete with San Miguel de Allende for the highest expat cost-of-living in Mexico. So it&#39;s just not the same for us as it was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondians/46235598555/in/album-72157706742911425/&quot; title=&quot;Untitled&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/7803/46235598555_682439e4c8_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;Untitled&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in 2019 we traveled with a friend to Guanajuato, Aguascalientes and Zacatecas, and in late February we also visited Morelia. There are pros and cons for each, but we liked Zacatecas the best. We are now living here, a six-hour ride away from Lake Chapala. This city and neighboring Guadalupe together have a population of around 300,000. The area is surrounded by Joshua trees and high desert. The altitude is about 8,300 feet. Drier, cooler, and much cheaper. Our very modern studio apartment is clocking in at just over $200US per month, which leaves a lot more room in our budget for savings and/or travel. One other major factor is that English speakers are quite rare here. That was a conscious decision on our part. It was becoming obvious that we could not continue to live in an area that prided itself for not needing to know Spanish if, in fact, we wanted to improve our Spanish!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In late February we traveled by bus with our friend Martha to the states of Michoacan and Mexico (formerly the federal district) to see the Mexican winter home of the Monarch butterfly. We stayed one night in Morelia, a large city  with a nice colonial downtown area. The AirBnB was in a noisy kinda dirty part of town, but was basically functional enough for one night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we hopped on another bus to the town of Zitacuaro and took a taxi to the J&amp;amp;M Butterfly B and B in the remote village of Macheros just inside the State of Mexico border. We enjoyed dinner and the view and the margaritas then rested up for the big day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning after breakfast we walked a couple of blocks to our horses then mounted up assisted by our guides. The poor things carried us all the way up Cerro Pelon with one break about halfway. We spent some time enjoying the river of monarchs flying by then went to the upper rest stop where we hiked down into a ravine to see the actual roost area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands and thousands of butterflies! It is hard to put it into words. Hopefully the pictures and video will do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a slideshow of our pictures from the trip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the video I put together - worth a small five-minute investment, I hope. You will have to watch it on the Flickr web site. To see it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/25atwqi&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

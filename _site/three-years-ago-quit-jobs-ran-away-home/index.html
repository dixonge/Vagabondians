<p>Today. Three years ago today was our <a href="https://vagabondians.com/escaping-system/" title="Escaping the System">last day at work</a>. We celebrated with friends and co-workers, we said our goodbyes.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we broke out of the cycle. We did the unexpected, the unusual. We changed the course of our lives.  Instead of doing what everyone else does and following our expected path, we took the next exit.</p>
<p>We Escaped Normal.</p>
<p>For three years now we have been traveling, seeing new places and meeting new people. We have been collecting memories and experiences. And we've been sharing them with you, our friends and family and followers. Thanks for coming along for the ride!</p>
<p>And now, on to the next three...</p>

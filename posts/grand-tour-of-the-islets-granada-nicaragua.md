When the Mombacho Volcano erupted thousands of years ago, it threw huge rocks into Lake Nicaragua forming 365 islets, very large to very small.

There is a community of about 1200 people living on them, mostly fishermen. Some islands have fabulous houses of the mega wealthy and others have humble cinder block simple dwellings, yet others are simply lush greenery and trees.  Many have hotels and cabanas and houses you can rent or buy.  For a price, a big price.

Lake Managua is huge, but usually calm, and we decided to take the tour boat all the way around the peninsula, touring through many of the islands.  It was a beautiful day, not too hot, and we took off to see what we would see.

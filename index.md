# Welcome

Shortly after Glenn's 50th birthday, he and his wife, Bryn, quit their jobs and went traveling. They spent the first year seeing the amazing sights and sounds of their home country.

[Six Months in a Popup](/tags/sixmonths/)

In 2012 they lived in and traveled throughout [Mexico](/tags/mexico/), from [Lake Chapala(/tags/chapala/)] in the west to [San Cristobal de las Casas](/tags/sancristobal/) in the east, as well as [Guatemala](/tags/guatemala/).

In 2013 they visited [Belize](/tags/belize/), [Nicaragua](/tags/nicaragua/), [Costa Rica](/tags/costarica/) and Mexico again. They moved back to Lake Chapala in 2014 until they almost ran out of money in 2015, at which point they moved back to [Texas](/tags/texas/). Glenn went back to work in Austin for two years until he finally vested in his pension plan, while Bryn walked dogs. They also became vegan. In 2017, at long last, Bryn was able to take her pension so they officially retired and moved back to Lake Chapala in Mexico!

Two years later they moved to higher ground in [Zacatecas](/tags/zacatecas/).

As of 2020 they have visited:

  - Seven countries
  - Forty-three states in the U.S.
  - Eighteen states in Mexico
  - Twenty-plus airports (from [Fairbanks, AK] to [Newark, NJ] to San Jose, Costa Rica)

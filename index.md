Shortly after Glenn's 50th birthday, he and his wife, Bryn, quit their jobs and went traveling. They spent the first year seeing the amazing sights and sounds of their home country.

[Six Months in a Popup](/tags/sixmonths/)

In 2012 they lived in and traveled throughout [Mexico](/tags/mexico/), from [Lake Chapala](/tags/chapala/) in the west to [San Cristobal de las Casas](/tags/sancristobal/) in the east, as well as [Guatemala](/tags/guatemala/).

In 2013 they visited [Belize](/tags/belize/), [Nicaragua](/tags/nicaragua/), [Costa Rica](/tags/costarica/) and Mexico again. They moved back to Lake Chapala's large expat community in 2014 until they almost ran out of money. In 2015 they moved back to [Texas](/tags/texas/). Glenn went back to work in Austin for two years until he finally vested in his pension plan, while Bryn walked dogs and experimented with recipes for their new vegan lifestyle. In 2017, at long last, Bryn was able to take her pension so they *officially* retired and moved back to Lake Chapala in Mexico!

Two years later they moved to [Zacatecas](/tags/zacatecas/). There they are enjoying the high desert, low rent, and getting more practice in Spanish as some of the very few gringos in town.

As of 2020 they have visited:

- Seven countries
- Forty-three states in the U.S.
- Eighteen states in Mexico
- Twenty-plus airports, from [Fairbanks, AK] to [Newark, NJ] to San Jose, Costa Rica
